   COMPLETELY REDONE WITH OVER 500 BRAND NEWVIDEOS!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Hi! Welcome to the brand new version of The Web Developer Bootcamp, Udemy's most popular web development course. This course was just completely overhauled to prepare students for the 2023 job market, with over 60 hours of brand new content. This is the
  <strong>
   only course you need to learn web development.
  </strong>
  There are a lot of options for online developer training, but this course is without a doubt the most comprehensive and effective on the market. Here's why:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    This is the only Udemy course taught by a professional bootcamp instructor with a track record of success.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     94% of my in-person bootcamp students go on to get full-time developer jobs
    </strong>
    . Most of them are complete beginners when I start working with them.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The previous 2 bootcamp programs that I taught cost
    <strong>
     $14,000 and $21,000
    </strong>
    . This course is just as comprehensive but with brand new content for a fraction of the price.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Everything I cover is up-to-date and relevant to 2022's developer job market.
    <strong>
     This course does not cut any corners. I just spent 8 months redoing this behemoth of a course!
    </strong>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    We build 13+ projects, including a
    <strong>
     gigantic production application
    </strong>
    called YelpCamp. No other course walks you through the creation of such a substantial application.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The course is
    <strong>
     constantly updated
    </strong>
    with new content, projects, and modules. Think of it as a subscription to a never-ending supply of developer training.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    You get to meet my cats and chickens!
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  When you're learning to program you often have to sacrifice learning the exciting and current technologies in favor of the ""beginner friendly"" classes. With this course, you get the best of both worlds. This is a course designed for the complete beginner, yet it covers some of the most exciting and relevant topics in the industry.
 </p>
 <p>
  Throughout the brand new version of the course we cover tons of tools and technologies including:

 </p>
 <p>
  JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world. It powers the entire modern web. It provides millions of high-paying jobs all over the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  That's why you want to learn JavaScript too. And you came to the right place!
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why is this the right JavaScript course for you?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   This is the most complete and in-depth JavaScript course on Udemy (and maybe the entire internet!). It's an all-in-one package that will take you from the very fundamentals of JavaScript, all the way to building modern and complex applications.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  You will learn modern JavaScript from the very beginning, step-by-step. I will guide you through
  <strong>
   practical and fun code examples
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   important theory
  </strong>
  about how JavaScript works behind the scenes, and
  <strong>
   beautiful and complete projects
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  You will become ready to continue learning advanced
  <strong>
   front-end frameworks
  </strong>
  like React, Vue, Angular, or Svelte.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will also learn how to think like a developer, how to plan application features, how to architect your code, how to debug code, and a lot of other real-world skills that you will need on your developer job.
 </p>
 <p>
  And unlike other courses, this one actually contains beginner, intermediate, advanced, and even expert topics, so
  <strong>
   you don't have to buy any other course in order to master JavaScript
  </strong>
  from the ground up!
 </p>
 <p>
  But... You don't have to go into all these topics. This is a huge course, because, after all, it's ""The Complete JavaScript Course"". In fact, it's like many courses in one!
  <strong>
   But you can become an excellent developer by watching only parts of the course
  </strong>
  . That's why I built this course in a very modular way, and designed pathways that will take you through the course faster.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   By the end of the course, you will have the knowledge and confidence that you need in order to ace your job interviews and become a professional developer.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why am I the right JavaScript teacher for you?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  My name is Jonas, I'm an experienced web developer and designer, and one of Udemy's top instructors. I have been teaching this bestselling course since 2016 to over 700,000 developers, always listening to feedback and understanding exactly how students actually learn.
 </p>
 <p>
  I know how students learn JavaScript and what they need in order to master it. And with that knowledge, I designed the ideal course curriculum.
  <strong>
   It's a unique blend of real-world projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges
  </strong>
  , that will take you from zero to an expert and confident JavaScript developer in just a couple of weeks.
 </p>
 <p>

  <strong>
   Java programming course online
  </strong>
  . With over 742,000 students enrolled and over one hundred and seventy four thousand reviews (
  <strong>
   with
  </strong>
  <strong>
   tens of thousands of those 5-star)
  </strong>
  to date, these comprehensive java tutorials cover everything you’ll ever need.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether you want to:
 </p>
 <p>
  - build the skills you need to get your firstJava programming job
 </p>
 <p>
  - move to a more senior software developer position
 </p>
 <p>
  - pass the oracle java certification exam
 </p>
 <p>
  - or just learn java to be able to create your own java apps (desktop or web based) quickly.
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  ...this complete Java Masterclass is the course you need to do all of this,
  <em>
   and more.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why would you choose to learn Java?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The reality is that there is a lot of computer languages out there. It's in the hundreds. Why would you choose the Java language?
 </p>
 <p>
  The number one reason is its popularity. According to many official websites that track the popularity of languages, Java is in the top 3 most popular languages worldwide in 2022.  Popularity means more companies and their staff are using it, so there are more career opportunities available for you if you are skilled in the language.
 </p>
 <p>
  The last thing you want to do is pick a language that is not in mainstream use. Java came out in the 1990s and is still very popular today and continually updated by the owners, Oracle, over 30 years later.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Are you aiming to get your first Java Programming job but struggling to find out what skills employers want
  </strong>
  and which course will give you those skills?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This course is designed to give you the Java skills you need to get a job as a Java developer. By the end of the course, you will understand Java extremely well and be able to build your own Java apps and be productive as a software developer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Lots of students have been successful in getting their first job or promotion after going through the course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here is just one example of a student who lost her job and despite having never coded in her life previously, got a full-time software developer position in just a few months after starting this course. She didn't even complete the course!
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   ""
  </strong>
  Three months ago I lost my job, came to a turning point in my life, and finally made the drastic decision to completely change course. I decided to switch career paths and go into coding. My husband found and gave me your Complete Java Masterclass at Udemy as a gift, and I wholeheartedly dove into it as a lifeline. Following your course has been absolutely enjoyable (still working on it, not yet finished), and has been a great way of keeping on course, dedicated and motivated. Yesterday, three months after starting the course, and honestly to my surprise, I received (and accepted!) a job offer as a full-time developer. I wanted to just drop you a line to say thank you for doing this work, for being such a dedicated teacher, and for putting all this knowledge available out there in such an approachable way. It has, literally, been life-changing.
  <strong>
   With gratitude, Laura""
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  The course is a whopping 100 hours long.
  <strong>
   Perhaps you have looked at the size of the course and are feeling a little overwhelmed at the prospect of finding time to complete it. Maybe you are wondering if you need to go through it all?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Firstly, Laura's story above shows that you do not have to complete the entire course - she was yet to complete the course when she accepted her developer job offer.
 </p>
 <p>
  Secondly, the course is designed as a one-stop shop for Java.
 </p>
 <p>
  The core java material you need to learn java development is covered in the first seven sections (around 14 hours in total). TheJava Basics are covered in those sections. The rest of the course covers intermediate, advanced, and optional material you do not technically need to go through.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For example section 13 is a whopping 10 hours just by itself and is aimed at those students who want to build desktop applications with graphical user interfaces. JavaFX(which is the technology used in this section) is something that most java developers will rarely or never need to work on. So you could skip that section entirely. But if you are one of the few that need to build user interfaces, then the content is there and ready for you. And there are other sections you can completely avoid if you wish.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you want to know absolutely everything about Java, then you can go through the entire course if you wish, but it's not necessary to do so if you are just looking to learn the essential information to get a java developer position.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What version of Java should you learn?
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  Generally speaking, you would want to learn the very latest version of a computer programming language, but
  <strong>
   that's not the case
  </strong>
  <strong>
   with Java.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Oracle, the owner of Java release many versions of Java. Some are released and expire in six months, with no future updates or support. Other versions have long-term support, for many years.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can probably see why learning a version of Java that has expired makes no sense, and is likely a waste of time.
 </p>
 <p>
  A company using Java technology(big or small) is not going to use a version of Java that has no updates or support. They will stick to stable, well-supported versions of Java that get updates.
 </p>
 <p>
  Right now, in December 2022, the version of Java that offers this long-term support(LTS) is Java 17 - It's being fully supported until at least 2029 and likely will be extended from there.
 </p>
 <p>
  As such, you want to learn the version of Java that your future employer will use, and that'sJava 17.
 </p>
 <p>
  The course will also be updated in the future as new LTS versions are announced by Oracle.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   BOTTOMLINE:You will learn the RIGHT VERSIONof JAVA in this course! Right meaning the right version to maximize your future Java potential with clients or Employers.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   Will this course give me core java skills?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Yes, it will. CoreJava is the fundamental part of the Java JDK (the java development kit) that programmers need to learn to move onto other more advanced technologies.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why should you take this course?
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's been a best-seller since its release on Udemy, you would be joining over 742,000 students who are already enrolled in the course.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are well over 174,000 reviews left by students. It's rated as the best course to learn Java for beginners.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   What makes this course a bestseller?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Like you, thousands of others were frustrated and fed up with fragmented Youtube tutorials or incomplete or outdated courses which assume you already know a bunch of stuff, as well as thick, college-like textbooks able to send even the most caffeine-fuelled coder to sleep.
 </p>
 <p>
  Like you, they were tired of low-quality lessons, poorly explained topics, and confusing info presented in the wrong way. That’s why so many find success in this complete Java developer course. It’s designed with simplicity and seamless progression in mind through its content.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This course assumes
  <strong>
   no previous coding experience
  </strong>
  and takes you from absolute beginner core concepts, like showing you the free tools you need to download and install, to writing your very first Java program. You will learn the core java skills you need to become employable in around 14 hours, and if you choose to, can take advantage of all the additional content in the course. It's a one-stop shop to learn java. If you want to go beyond the core content you can do so at any time.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Here’s just some of what you’ll learn
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  (It’s okay if you don’t understand all this yet, you will in the course)
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    All the essential Java keywords, operators, statements, and expressions needed to fully understand exactly what you’re coding and why - making programming easy to grasp and less frustrating
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    You will learn the answers to questions like What is a Java class, What is polymorphism and inheritance and to apply them to your java apps.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    How to safely download and install all necessary coding tools with less time and no frustrating installations or setups
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Complete chapters on object-oriented programming and many aspects of the Java API (the protocols and tools for building applications) so you can code for all platforms and derestrict your program’s user base (and potential sales)
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    How to develop powerful Java applications using one of the most powerful Integrated Development Environments on the market, IntelliJ IDEA! - Meaning you can code functional programs easier.
    <strong>
     IntelliJ
    </strong>
    has both a
    <strong>
     FREE
    </strong>
    andPAID version, and you can use either in this course.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  (Don’t worry if you’re used to using Eclipse, NetBeans, or some other IDE. You’re free to use any IDE and still get the most out of this course)
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Learn Java to a sufficient level to be a be to transition to core Java technologies like Android development, the Spring framework, Java EE(Enterprise edition) in general as well as and other technologies. In order to progress to these technologies, you need to first learn core Java - the fundamental building blocks. That's what this course will help you to achieve.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    “AP-what?”
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Don't worry if none of that made sense. I go into great detail explaining each and every core concept, programming term, and buzzwords you need to create your own Java programs.
 </p>
 <p>
  This truly is Java for complete beginners.
 </p>
 <p>
  By the end of this comprehensive course, you’ll master Java programming no matter what level of experience you’re at right now. You’ll understand what you are doing, and why you are doing it. This isn’t a recipe book, you’ll use your own creativity to make unique, intuitive programs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only do these HD videos show you how to become a programmer in great detail, but this course includes a unique
  <strong>
   challenge feature
  </strong>
  . Each time a core concept is taught, a video presents a challenge for you to help you understand what you have just learned in a
  <em>
   real-world scenario.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  You’ll go and complete the challenge on your own, then come back and see the answers which I then explain in detail in a video, allowing you to check your results and identify any areas you need to go back and work on.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is a proven way to help you
  <em>
   understand
  </em>
  Java faster and ensure you reach your goal of becoming a Java Developer in record time. Remember doing those old past exam papers in high school or college? It’s the same concept, and it works.
 </p>
 <p>
  As your instructor, I have close to
  <strong>
   40 years of experience
  </strong>
  as a software developer and teacher and have been using Java since the year 2000. Yes, over 22 years
  <em>
   (I’ve taught students younger than that)
  </em>
  . Meaning not only can I teach this content with great simplicity, but I can make it fun too!
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s no surprise my previous students have amazing results...
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   See what your fellow students have to say:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  ""This course was a guiding light in my ""Becoming a developer"" path from the first step. It helped me become a much more educated developer comparing to my friend who learned to code from trial/error. It's still a guide for me. every now and then I will come back to this course to learn something new or to improve what I've learned somewhere else. A BIG Thanks to ""Tim Buchalka"" my Master."" - Sina Jz
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ""I was an absolute beginner when I started this course, and now I can write some good small advanced clean codes. I wrote a code and showed it to a programmer, and he was shocked, he told me that I'm more than ready to start a programming career."" - Amirreza Moeini
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ""I am taking this class in conjunction with a Java 101 college class. I have learned more in one afternoon of videos from this class than I have in 4 weeks of a college class. Tim actually explains what things are and why they do what they do, as opposed to my college instructor that mainly said ""go make a program that does *whatever*"" and then I had to figure out a program that would meet those requirements but not actually learning why it worked."" - Stacy Harris
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s safe to say my students are thrilled with this course, and more importantly, their results,
  <em>
   and you can be too
  </em>
  …
 </p>
 <p>
  This complete Java course will teach you everything you need to know in order to code awesome, profitable projects,
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   Is the course updated?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  As mentioned above, yes.
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New, more powerful hardware and software are being released
  <em>
   every day
  </em>
  , meaning it’s crucial to stay on top with the latest knowledge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A lot of other courses on Udemy get released once, and never get updated. Learning an older version of Java can be counterproductive - you could be learning the ""old way"" of doing things, rather than using current technology.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Make sure you check the last updated date on the page of any course you plan to buy - you will be shocked to see some have not been updated for years.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  That’s why I’m always adding new, up-to-date content to this course at
  <strong>
   no extra charge
  </strong>
  . Buy this course once, and you’ll have lifetime access to it and any future updates (which are on the way as we speak).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And when I say updated, I also mean enhanced. With the recently released Java 17 update, a lot of the content has changed to actually include features included in Java 17.

   Absolutely fantastic tutorial series. I cannot thank you enough. The quality is first class and your presentational skills are second to none. Keep up this excellent work. You really rock!﻿ - Paul Whitehouse
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   The instructor, Max, is very enthusiastic and engaging. He does a great job of explaining what he's doing and why rather than having students just mimic his coding. Max was also very responsive to questions. I would recommend this course and any others that he offers. Thanks, Max!
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   As a person new to both JavaScript and Angular 2 I found this course extremely helpful because Max does a great job of explaining all the important concepts behind the code. Max has a great teaching ability to focus on what his audience needs to understand.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   This Course uses TypeScript
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  TypeScript is the main language used by the official Angularteam and the language you'll mostly see in Angular tutorials. It's a superset to JavaScript and makes writing Angularapps really easy. Using it ensures, that you will have the best possible preparation for creating Angularapps. Check out the free videos for more information.
 </p>
 <p>
  TypeScript knowledge is, however, not required - basic JavaScript knowledge is enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why Angular?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Angularis the next big deal. Being the successor of the overwhelmingly successful Angular.js framework it’s bound to shape the future of frontend development in a similar way. The powerful features and capabilities of Angularallow you to create complex, customizable, modern, responsive and user friendly web applications.
 </p>
 <p>
  Angular 13simply is the latest version of the Angular framework and simply an update to Angular 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  Angular is faster than Angular 1 and offers a much more flexible and modular development approach. After taking this course you’ll be able to fully take advantage of all those features and start developing awesome applications immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to the drastic differences between Angular 1 and Angular(=Angular 13)you don’t need to know anything about Angular.js to be able to benefit from this course and build your futures projects with Angular.
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
  ""Become An Android Developer From Scratch” is designed to be the best first step to launching your career as an Android Developer. Whether you've never programmed before or are coming to mobile development for the first time, if you're truly inspired to learn Android Development, this is where you need to start.
 </p>
 <p>
  This course has been in development for over two years, continuously perfected through research and testing in training bootcamps throughout the US. It represents a collaboration between a professional educator with over 20 years of experience in helping people learn and a professional mobile developer who has helped companies like Sony, Verizon, and nVidia build stunning mobile applications.
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting with how the Java programming language works and progressing all the way to advanced Android concepts, you will get expertly produced instruction, visually descriptive explanations of deep concepts, screencasts that talk you through not just the “how” but also the “why,” and code challenges to test yourself and mark your progress.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Here’s what students are saying:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  “Very clean and well done. Covers everything that you need to know for getting started whether you know how to code starting out or not. If you are at a loss trying to start making android apps this is the course for you.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “I like this course, this would transform any normal person to a full fledged android developer.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “This one is, by far, the most comprehensive, easy-to-follow, and genuinely well put together one of the bunch.”
 </p>
 <p>
  “Inspirational! - got me over the hump (complete android beginner)”
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why it’s working...
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the things we're most excited to offer with this course is access to the inner workings of the mind of a professional mobile developer. Throughout the course you will be able to listen in as our Learning Scientist teases apart all the thoughts that run through a professional mobile developer’s mind as he’s writing the code you will learn to create. It’s like sitting down in a movie with the writer, director, and lead actor. But in this case, it’s all in support of your transformation from novice to professional.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will build several applications throughout the course, and the starting point for each project (as well as solutions to each challenge) will be available for download. You will also get all the visuals and info-graphics used throughout the course for reference and study.
 </p>
 <p>
  ""Become An Android Developer From Scratch"" will give you a new, richer perspective on how mobile devices work. After you’ve completed this rigorous, challenging, and super fun course, you will be able to create your own apps, deploy to the Google Play store, and even interview for a job anywhere in the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   The real value...
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The most important thing you will get from completing this course is the confidence to say “I’m an Android Developer!” You’ll be able to interact with other students and professionals in the Android community with pride and self-assuredness. You’ll also become an independent learner, able to discern where to go for information and how to continue advancing your skills.
 </p>
 <p>
  No course is going to make you into an expert. It’s up to you to challenge yourself and find your path to making the apps you dream about. Become an Android Developer from Scratch is the best place to begin. Are you ready to get started?

 <p>
  <strong>
   The Problem
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Data scientist is one of the best suited professions to thrive this century. It is digital, programming-oriented, and analytical. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the demand for data scientists has been surging in the job marketplace.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, supply has been very limited. It is difficult to acquire the skills necessary to be hired as a data scientist.
 </p>
 <p>
  And how can you do that?
 </p>
 <p>
  Universities have been slow at creating specialized data science programs. (not to mention that the ones that exist are very expensive and time consuming)
 </p>
 <p>
  Most online courses focus on a specific topic and it is difficult to understand how the skill they teach fit in the complete picture
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   The Solution
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Data science is a multidisciplinary field. It encompasses a wide range of topics.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Understanding of the data science field and the type of analysis carried out
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Mathematics
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Statistics
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Python
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Applying advanced statistical techniques in Python
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Data Visualization
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Machine Learning
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Deep Learning
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Each of these topics builds on the previous ones. And you risk getting lost along the way if you don’t acquire these skills in the right order. For example, one would struggle in the application of Machine Learning techniques before understanding the underlying Mathematics. Or, it can be overwhelming to study regression analysis in Python before knowing what a regression is.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    So, in an effort to create the most effective, time-efficient, and structured data science training available online, we created The Data Science Course 2023.
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  We believe this is the first training program that solves the biggest challenge to entering the data science field
  <strong>
   – having all the necessary resources in one place.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Moreover, our focus is to teach topics that flow smoothly and complement each other. The course teaches you everything you need to know to become a data scientist at a fraction of the cost of traditional programs (not to mention the amount of time you will save).
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   The Skills
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   1.Intro to Data and Data Science
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Big data, business intelligence, business analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We know these buzzwords belong to the field of data science but what do they all mean?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why learn it?
  </strong>
  As a candidate data scientist, you must understand the ins and outs of each of these areas and recognise the appropriate approach to solving a problem. This ‘Intro to data and data science’ will give you a comprehensive look at all these buzzwords and where they fit in the realm of data science.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   2. Mathematics
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Learning the tools is the first step to doing data science. You must first see the big picture to then examine the parts in detail.
 </p>
 <p>
  We take a detailed look specifically at calculus and linear algebra as they are the subfields data science relies on.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why learn it?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Calculus and linear algebra are essential for programming in data science. If you want to understand advanced machine learning algorithms, then you need these skills in your arsenal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   3. Statistics
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  You need to think like a scientist before you can become a scientist. Statistics trains your mind to frame problems as hypotheses and gives you techniques to test these hypotheses, just like a scientist.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why learn it?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  This course doesn’t just give you the tools you need but teaches you how to use them. Statistics trains you to think like a scientist.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   4. Python
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Python is a relatively new programming language and, unlike R, it is a general-purpose programming language. You can do anything with it! Web applications, computer games and data science are among many of its capabilities. That’s why, in a short space of time, it has managed to disrupt many disciplines. Extremely powerful libraries have been developed to enable data manipulation, transformation, and visualisation. Where Python really shines however, is when it deals with machine and deep learning.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why learn it?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  When it comes to developing, implementing, and deploying machine learning models through powerful frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc, Python is a must have programming language.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   5. Tableau
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Data scientists don’t just need to deal with data and solve data driven problems. They also need to convince company executives of the right decisions to make. These executives may not be well versed in data science, so the data scientist must but be able to present and visualise the data’s story in a way they will understand. That’s where Tableau comes in – and we will help you become an expert story teller using the leading visualisation software in business intelligence and data science.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why learn it?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  A data scientist relies on business intelligence tools like Tableau to communicate complex results to non-technical decision makers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   6. Advanced Statistics
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Regressions, clustering, and factor analysis are all disciplines that were invented before machine learning. However, now these statistical methods are all performed through machine learning to provide predictions with unparalleled accuracy. This section will look at these techniques in detail.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why learn it?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Data science is all about predictive modelling and you can become an expert in these methods through this ‘advance statistics’ section.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   7. Machine Learning
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The final part of the program and what every section has been leading up to is deep learning. Being able to employ machine and deep learning in their work is what often separates a data
  <em>
   scientist
  </em>
  from a data
  <em>
   analyst.
  </em>
  This section covers all common machine learning techniques and deep learning methods with TensorFlow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why learn it?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Machine learning is everywhere. Companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have been using machines that can learn on their own for years. Now is the time for
  <em>
   you
  </em>
  to control the machines.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>

  Welcome this comprehensive Ethical Hacking course! This course assumesyou have
  <strong>
   NOprior knowledge
  </strong>
  and by the end of it you'll be able to
  <strong>
   hack systems like black-hat hackers
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   secure them like security experts!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Thiscourse ishighly
  <strong>
   practical
  </strong>
  but it won't neglect the theory; we'll start with ethical hacking basics, breakdown the different penetration testing fields and install the needed software (on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X), then we'll dive and start hacking straight away. You'll
  <strong>
   learn everything by example
  </strong>
  , by analysing and exploiting different systems such as networks, servers, clients, websites .....etc. We'll never have any boring dry theoretical lectures.
 </p>
 <p>
  The course is divided into a number of sections, each section covers a penetration testing / hacking field, in each of these sections you'll first learn how the target system works, the weaknesses of this system, and how to
  <strong>
   practically
  </strong>
  exploit theses weaknesses to hack this system.
 </p>
 <p>
  By the end of the course you will have a strong foundation in most hacking or penetration testing fields and you'll also learn how to
  <strong>
   detect, prevent and secure
  </strong>
  systems and yourself fromthe discussed attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  The course is divided into four main sections:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   1.Network Hacking
  </strong>
  <em>
   -
  </em>
  This section will teach you how to test the security of both wired &amp; wireless networks. First, you will learn network basics, how they work, and how devices communicate with each other. Then it will branch into three sub sections:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Pre-connection
    <strong>
    </strong>
    attacks:
    <em>
    </em>
    in this subsection you'll learn a number of attacks that can be executed without connecting to the target network and without the need to know the network password; you'll learn how to
    <strong>
     gatherinformation
    </strong>
    about the networks around you, discover connected devices, and control connections (
    <strong>
     deny/allow devices from connecting to networks
    </strong>
    ).
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Gaining Access: Now that you gathered information aboutthe networks around you, in this subsection you will learn how to
    <strong>
     crack
    </strong>
    the key and get the password to your target network whether it uses
    <strong>
     WEP, WPA
    </strong>
    or even
    <strong>
     WPA2
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Post Connection attacks: Now that you have the key, you can connect to the target network, in this subsection you will learn a number of
    <strong>
     powerful techniques
    </strong>
    that allow you to gather comprehensive information about the connected devices,
    <strong>
     see anything they do on the internet
    </strong>
    (such as login information,
    <strong>
     passwords
    </strong>
    , visited urls, images, videos ....etc), redirect requests,
    <strong>
     inject evil code
    </strong>
    in loaded pages and much more! All of these attacks work against both wireless and wired networks. You will also learn how to
    <strong>
     create a fake WiFi network,
    </strong>
    attract users to connect to it and use all of the above techniques against the connected clients.
   </p>
   <p>
    <br/>
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <strong>
   2.Gaining Access
  </strong>
  <em>
   -
  </em>
  In this section you will learn two main approaches to
  <strong>
   gain full control or hackcomputer systems
  </strong>
  :
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Server Side Attacks
    <em>
     :
    </em>
    In this subsection you will learn how to
    <strong>
     gain full access
    </strong>
    to computer systems
    <strong>
     without user interaction
    </strong>
    . You will learn how to gather useful information about a target computer system such as itsoperating system,open ports, installed services, then use this information to
    <strong>
     discover weaknesses and vulnerabilities
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
     exploit
    </strong>
    them to gain full control over the target. Finally you willlearn how to automatically scan servers for vulnerabilities and generate different types of
    <strong>
     reports
    </strong>
    with your discoveries.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Client Side Attacks
    <em>
     -
    </em>
    If the target system does not contain any weaknesses then the only way to hack it is by interacting with the users, in this subsection you'll learn how to get the target user to install a backdoor on their system without even realising, this is done by
    <strong>
     hijacking software updates
    </strong>
    or
    <strong>
     backdooring downloads
    </strong>
    on the fly. This subsection also teaches you how to use social engineering to hack secure systems, so you'll learn how to gather comprehensive information about system users such as their social accounts, friends, their mails.....etc, you'll learn how to
    <strong>
     create trojans
    </strong>
    by backdooring normal files (such as an image or a pdf) and use the gathered information to spoof emails so they appear as if they're sent from the target's friend, boss or any email account they're likely to interact with, to social engineer them into running your trojan.
   </p>
   <p>
    <br/>
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <strong>
   3.Post Exploitation
  </strong>
  <em>
   -
  </em>
  In this section you will learn how to interact with the systems you compromised so far. You’lllearn how to
  <strong>
   access the file system
  </strong>
  (read/write/upload/execute),
  <strong>
   maintain your access
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   spy
  </strong>
  on the target (capture key strikes, turn on the webcam, take screenshots....etc) and evenuse the target computer as a
  <strong>
   pivot
  </strong>
  to hack other systems.
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   4.Website / Web Application Hacking
  </strong>
  <em>
   -
  </em>
  In this section you will learn
  <strong>
   how websites work
  </strong>
  , how to
  <strong>
   gather information
  </strong>
  about a target website (such as website owner, server location, used technologies ....etc) and how to
  <strong>
   discover
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   exploit
  </strong>
  the following dangerous
  <strong>
   vulnerabilities
  </strong>
  to hack websites:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    File Upload.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Code Execution.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Local File Inclusion.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Remote File Inclusion.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    SQL Injection.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Cross Site Scripting (XSS).
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end of each section you willlearn how to
  <strong>
   detect, prevent and secure
  </strong>
  systems and yourself fromthe discussed attacks.
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <p>
  All the techniques in this course are
  <strong>
   practical
  </strong>
  and work against real systems, you'll understand the whole mechanism of each technique first, then you'll learn how to use it to hack the target system. By the end of the course you'll be able to modify these techniques to launch more powerful attacks, and adopt them to suit different situations and different scenarios.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this course you'll get
  <strong>
   24/7 support
  </strong>
  , so if you have any questions you can post them in the Q&amp;A section and we'll respond to you within 15 hours.

  The contents of this course are all based on my work experience at several firms, including Goldman Sachs, the consulting industry at Accenture, a few companies I have started, the hedge fund industry where I worked at Citadel and also in the venture capital sector (the firm I founded had a venture capital investment in Facebook).I included helpful practical business concepts I learned while I did an MBA at Columbia University and a Bachelor of Commerce degree at McGill University. Think of this course as a “greatest hits” business summaries from my MBA, undergraduate business degree, work experience in consulting, equities, hedge funds, venture capital and starting my own companies.

Professor Haroun's approach of doing away with the theoretical jargon and instead providing a rich-in-practical-content makes this course an absolute MUST for students, young and matured executives, business owners of small or large companies to attend. Professor Haroun is an excellent speaker, an invigorating lecturer of whose passion is fervently contagious. As a business owner of 25 years, I wish I had come across Professor Haroun's knowledge and inspiring attitude many years ago. The course material is comprehensive, easy to understand and Professor Haroun's sense of humour and his inclusion of applicable videoclips in his downloadable course material adds spice to the whole experience.

  <strong>
   lifetime access
  </strong>
  for a single one-off fee. The creators are qualified and experienced coders and avid gamers, so are able to explain complex concepts clearly, as well as entertain along the way.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will
  <strong>
   learn C#,
  </strong>
  and in turn build a solid foundation for Object Oriented Programming. By the end of the course you'll be very confident in the basics of coding and game development, and hungry to learn more.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>

 <p>
  <strong>
   Why learn SQL?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <p>
    SQL is the most universal and commonly used database language. It powers the most commonly used database engines like PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite, and MySQL. Simply put, If you want to access databases then yes, you need to know SQL.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <p>
    It is not really difficult to learn SQL. SQL is not a programming language, it’s a query language. The primary objective where SQL was created was to give the possibility to common people to get interesting data from the database. It is also an English-like language so anyone who can use English at a basic level can write SQL queries easily.
   </p>

  <strong>
   What's the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  SQL is a language. Specifically, the ""Structured Query Language""
 </p>
 <p>
  PostgreSQL is one of several database systems, or RDMS (Relational Database Management System). PostgresSQL is one of several RDMS's, others of which are Oracle, Informix, MySQL, and MSQL.
 </p>
 <p>
  All of these RDMSs use SQL as their language. Each of them have minor variations in the ""dialect"" of SQL that they use, but it's all still SQL.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Which is better, PostgreSQL or MySQL?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Both are excellent products with unique strengths, and the choice is often a matter of personal preference.
 </p>
 <p>
  PostgreSQL offers overall features for traditional database applications, while MySQL focuses on faster performance for Web-based applications.
 </p>
 <p>
  Open source development will bring more features to subsequent releases of both databases.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Who uses these databases?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Here are a few examples of companies that use PostgreSQL: Apple, BioPharm, Etsy, IMDB, Macworld, Debian, Fujitsu, Red Hat, Sun Microsystem, Cisco, Skype.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>

 </p>
 <p>
  Here’s what a few students have told us about the course after going through it.
 </p>
 <p>
  “I had very limited programming experience before I started this course, so I have really learned a lot from the first few sections. It has taken me from essentially zero programming skill to a level where I'm comfortable using Python to analyze data for my lab reports, and I'm not even halfway done the course yet. There are other courses out there which focus on data analysis, but those courses are usually targeted at people who already know how to program which is why I chose this course instead. “ – Christian DiMaria
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “I have been puttering through your Python course . In that time, though, and without finishing it yet I've been able to automate quite a bit at my work. I work in a school system and unifying data from our various student information systems can be incredibly frustrating, time consuming, and at times challenging. Using your course, I've learned enough to write applications that turn massive text files into dictionaries that get ""stitched"" together like a database and output to properly formatted CSV files and then uploaded via SFTP to various systems for secure processing. Our teachers, students, and the tech department have greatly benefitted from this automation. I just wanted to drop you a note thanking you for helping me learn this skill.” – Keith Medlin
  <br/>
  <br/>
  “This course was great. Within 3 weeks I was able to write my own database related applications.” – Theo Coenen
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And there are many more students who love the course – check out all the reviews for yourself.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Will this course give you core python skills?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Yes it will. There are a range of exciting opportunities for Python developers. All of them require a solid understanding of Python, and that’s what you will learn in this course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Will the course teach me data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  No, it won’t do that – All of these topics are branches of Python programming. And all of them require a solid understanding of the Python language.
 </p>
 <p>
  Nearly all courses on these topics assume that you understand Python, and without it you will quickly become lost and confused.
 </p>
 <p>
  This course will give you that core, solid understanding of the Python programming language.
 </p>
 <p>
  By the end of the course you will be ready to apply for Python programming positions as well as move on to specific areas of Python, as listed above.

  There are a lot of Python courses on Udemy – Your instructors, Tim and Jean-Paul are pretty unique in that between them they have around 70 years of professional programming experience. That’s more than a lifetime of skills you get to learn Python from.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can enrol in the course safe in the knowledge that they are not just teachers, but professional programmers with real commercial programming experience, having worked with big companies like IBM, Mitsubishi, Fujitsu and Saab in the past.
 </p>
 <p>
  As such you will not only be learning Python, but you will be learning industry best practices for Python programming that real employers demand.
 </p>
 <p>
  And if that’s not enough take a read of some of the many reviews from happy students – there are around 100,000 students who have left around 19,000 reviews.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is one of the most popular courses on Python programming on Udemy.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Here’s just some of what you’ll learn
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  (It’s okay if you don’t understand all this yet, you will in the course)
 </p>
 <p>
  · All the essential Python keywords, operators, statements, and expressions needed to fully understand exactly what you’re coding and why - making programming easy to grasp and less frustrating
 </p>
 <p>
  · You will learn the answers to questions like What is the Python For Loop, what is Python used for, how Python switch the traditional syntax of code, and more.
 </p>
 <p>
  · Complete chapters on object-oriented programming and many other aspects of Python, including tKInter (for building GUI Interfaces) and using databases with Python.
 </p>
 <p>
  · Although this is primarily a Python 3 course, a python developer will need to work with Python 2 projects from time to time – We’ll show the difference in both versions to make sure you understand how things work differently in each version.
 </p>
 <p>
  · How to develop powerful Python applications using one of the most powerful Integrated Development Environments on the market, IntelliJ IDEA! - Meaning you can code functional programs easier.
  <strong>
   IntelliJ
  </strong>
  has both a
  <strong>
   FREE
  </strong>
  andPAID version, and you can use either in this course. PyCharm will also work just fine.
 </p>
 <p>
  (Don’t worry if you want to use another IDE. You’re free to use any IDE and still get the most out of this course).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   Does the course get updated?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New, more powerful hardware and software are being released
  <em>
   every day
  </em>
  , meaning it’s crucial to stay on top with the latest knowledge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A lot of other courses on Udemy get released once, and never get updated. Learning from an outdated course and/or an outdated version of Python can be counter productive and even worse it could teach you the wrong way to do things.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example if you apply some parts of Python 2 to Python 3 code, you will get completely different results.
 </p>
 <p>
  We cover differences like this in the course and also continually update the course as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    What if you have questions?
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  As if this course wasn’t complete enough, we offer
  <strong>
   full support
  </strong>
  , answering any questions you have
  <strong>
   7 days a week
  </strong>
  (whereas many instructors answer just once per week,
  <em>
   or not at all
  </em>
  ).
 </p>
 <p>
  This means you’ll never find yourself stuck on one lesson for days on end. With our hand-holding guidance, you’ll progress smoothly through this course without any major roadblocks.
 </p>
 <p>
  That’s just one reason why Tim was voted
  <strong>
   top 10 in the Udemy instructor awards
  </strong>
  (out of a whopping 18,000 instructors), and quickly became a top-rated, bestselling instructor on the Udemy site.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Student Quote: “
  </em>
  Tim and JP are excellent teachers and are constantly answering questions and surveying students on new topics they will like to learn. This isn't a Python course it’s THE Python course you need.” – Sean Burger
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    There’s no risk either!
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  This course comes with a
  <strong>
   full 30 day money-back guarantee

 </p>
 <p>

   Why Learn MySQL
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Consistently ranked the most in-demand skill in recent employer surveys, SQL is a fantastic way to increase your income and boost your professional development. So many companies today use MySQL, including Twitter, Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, Github, Kickstarter, Udemy, Slack, and many others.
  <strong>
   Unsure about the difference between SQL and MySQL?
  </strong>
  MySQL is the most popular open source SQL database out there, so it’s a great choice to begin your learning journey. We’ll talk a lot more about the difference between SQL and MySQL in the course, but 95% of what you learn about MySQL in this course will apply to other databases such as Postgres, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why This Course Is Different
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  This isn’t going to be a course where you watch me code for 20 hours; it’s a course with
  <strong>
   ample opportunity for you to get your hands dirty writing code
  </strong>
  (even within the first 7 minutes of the course).
 </p>
 <p>
  My teaching experience is rooted in the classroom. I’ve spent years teaching programming, web development, and databases to my in-person bootcamp students. This course combines the best of my offline courses with the convenience of learning online, in a setting that’s best for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon completing this course, you’ll be able to interact with and query any SQL database out there. You’ll also be able to generate reports with ease, answer company performance questions using data, and integrate MySQL into complete applications.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   So let’s do this! Enroll today and start learning SQL!

  Open a new browser tab, type in

 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Amazing, right? What if you knew exactly how to design and build a website like that, completely from scratch? How amazing would that be?
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, I'm here to teach you
  <strong>
   HTML, CSS, and web design, all by building the stunning website that you just saw
  </strong>
  , step-by-step.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, after finishing this course, you will know exactly how to build a beautiful, professional, and ready-to-launch website just like Omnifood, by following a 7-step process. And it will even look great on any computer, tablet, and smartphone.
 </p>
 <p>
  But what if you want to build a completely different website? Well, no problem! I designed the course curriculum with exactly this goal: to
  <strong>
   enable you to design and build any website that you can think of, not just copy the course project
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   So, in order to become a confident and independent developer, capable of building your own websites in the future, you will learn:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    The fundamentals of modern and semantic HTML, CSS, and building layouts in a small separate project, which will prepare you for the main course project (
    <em>
     www.omnifood.dev
    </em>
    ). This includes modern flexbox and CSS Grid!
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    How to design beautiful websites, by learning a web design framework I created just for this course. It consists of easy-to-use guidelines for design aspects like typography, colors, images, spacing, and more (this is like a small standalone course!).
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    How to use well-established website components and layout patterns in order to come up with professional-looking designs
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    How to make any website work on any mobile device, no matter the design and layout (responsive design)
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    How to use the 7 steps of building a professional website in practice: planning, sketching, designing, building, testing, optimizing, and launching
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    How to find and use free design assets such as images, fonts, and icons
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Important developer skills such as reading documentation, fixing code errors on your own, and using professional web development tools
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   [01] Why should you learn HTML and CSS in the first place?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Building websites allows you to do
  <strong>
   fun and creative work, from anywhere in the world, and it even pays well
  </strong>
  . Web development is one of the
  <strong>
   most future-proof and highest-paying industries
  </strong>
  in the world. And HTML and CSS is the entry point to this world!
 </p>
 <p>
  But you already know all this, that's why you want to learn HTML and CSS too. Well, you came to the right place!
 </p>
 <p>
  This is the best and most complete course for starting your web development journey that you will find on Udemy. It's an
  <strong>
   all-in-one package
  </strong>
  that takes you from knowing nothing about HTML and CSS, to building beautiful websites using tools and technologies that professional web developers use every single day.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   [02] Why is this course so unique and popular?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Reason #1: The course is completely project-based
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Simple demos are boring, and therefore you're gonna learn everything by
  <strong>
   building actual projects
  </strong>
  ! In the final project (
  <em>
   www.omnifood.dev
  </em>
  ), together we hand-code a beautiful and responsive landing page for a
  <strong>
   fictional company
  </strong>
  that I made up just for the course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Reason #2: You will not just learn how to code
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Coding is great, but it's not everything! That's why we will go through the entire
  <strong>
   7-step process
  </strong>
  of building and launching our website project.
 </p>
 <p>
  So the huge Omnifood project will teach you
  <strong>
   real-world skills to build real-world HTML and CSS websites
  </strong>
  : how to plan projects and page layouts, how to implement designs using HTML and CSS techniques, how to write clean and organized code, how to optimize websites for good speed performance, and many more.
 </p>
 <p>
  On top of that, this course has a
  <strong>
   huge focus on beautiful design
  </strong>
  . In fact, this is the only course on the market that focuses on both coding and designing, together.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Reason #3: I'm the right teacher for you
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  With the right guidance and a well-structured curriculum, building websites can be
  <strong>
   quite easy and fun to learn
  </strong>
  . With a bunch of random tutorials and YouTube videos? Not so much. And that's where I come in.
 </p>
 <p>
  My name is Jonas, I'm an experienced web developer and designer, and one of Udemy's top instructors. I have been teaching this bestselling course since 2015 to over 200,000 developers, always listening to feedback and understanding exactly how students actually learn.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using that feedback, I recently rebuilt this course from scratch and
  <strong>
   designed the ideal course curriculum
  </strong>
  for every type of student. It's a
  <strong>
   unique blend
  </strong>
  of projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges. I'm sure you're gonna love it!
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   [03] Why is this course so long?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Reason #1:
  </strong>
  I take time to
  <strong>
   explain every single concept
  </strong>
  that I teach, so that you actually learn, and not just copy code from the screen (
  <strong>
   this is a course
  </strong>
  , not a tutorial)
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Reason #2:
  </strong>
  I go into topics that other HTML and CSS courses shy away from: professional web design, component and layout patterns, some CSS theory, website planning in theory and practice, and developer skills. I believe you need all of this to be successful!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Reason #3:
  </strong>
  There is a lot of repetition, so that you actually
  <strong>
   assimilate and practice
  </strong>
  what you learn. Practice is the single most important ingredient to learning, and therefore I provide plenty of opportunities for you to sharpen your skills
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   [04] Here is what's also included in the package:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Up-to-date HD-quality videos, that are easy to search and reference (great for Udemy Business students)
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Professional English captions (not theauto-generated ones)
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Downloadable design assets + starter code and final code for each section
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Downloadable slides for 20+ theory videos (not boring, I promise!)
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Access to countless free design and development resources that I curated over many years
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Free support in the course Q&amp;A
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    10+ coding challenges to practice your new skills (solutions included)
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   [05] This course is for you if...
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    ... you are a complete beginner with no idea of how to build a website.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    ... you already know a bit of HTML and CSS from some tutorials or videos, but struggle to put together a good-looking, complete website.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    ... you are a designer and want to expand your skills into HTML and CSS, because all your designer friends are learning how to code (they are smart!).
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Basically, if you are an HTML and CSS master, and build the most beautiful websites in the world, then DON'T take the course. Everyone else: you should take the course, today.

  What you'll learn:
 </b>
 <br/>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Display, position, and move filled shapes for retro and prototype gameplay
  </li>
  <li>
   Move a ball around your game space such that it bounces off boundaries

  </li>
  <li>
   Define and code a win condition and end state for your game
  </li>
 </ul>
 <br/>
 <p>
  At the end of this short course you'll have programmed your first game. You'll learn gameplay development fundamentals by really doing it – writing and running real code on your own machine.
 </p>
 <p>
  Each step of the course has the source code attached exactly as it should look at that time (click ""View Resources"" then ""Downloadable Resources""), for you to compare to or pick up from, so you can't get stuck!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Begin Your Game Programming Journey the Proven Way
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  ""Make the simplest game possible."" ""Program a ball and paddle project."" ""Practice by first remaking something from the 1970's."" All beginning developers hear this advice from more experienced peers... because it works!
 </p>
 <p>
  By following this approach you will:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Learn design from a fun classic that people know and enjoy.
  </li>
  <li>
   Start your practice today – now! – without waiting for an idea.
  </li>
  <li>
   Finish your game in hours or in a weekend, not over months.
  </li>
  <li>
   Understand every line of code used in the entire program.
  </li>
  <li>
   Avoid distraction from searching for or creating detailed art.
  </li>
  <li>
   Master fundamentals needed to make your own games better.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  You can program this game with a normal text editor, and run it in the web browser you already have. No special software is needed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though you'll be coding in JavaScript for HTML5 canvas in this course, the focus is on common game programming concepts. You can later apply these same patterns to get quick results in other programming languages such as C#, Java, ActionScript 3, C++, or Python.
 </p>
 <p>
  I'm a private game development trainer, and for clients new to gameplay programming this is exactly the material that I cover to get them started quickly. Within hours you will have finished programming your first project. This is the fastest way to get results. The momentum gained from doing this provides a solid foundation to give more advanced concepts meaning and context as you continue on in your journey of learning game development.

   FAQs
  </strong>
  of students who want to start their Machine learning journey-
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What is Machine Learning?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Machine Learning is a field of computer science which gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why use Python for Machine Learning?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Though it hasn’t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here’s a brief history:
 </p>
 <p>
  In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets’s annual poll of data scientists’ most used tools.
 </p>
 <p>
  In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.
 </p>
 <p>
  Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it’s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why use R for Machine Learning?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R
 </p>
 <p>
  1. It’s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it’s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science.
 </p>
 <p>
  4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it’s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.
 </p>
 <p>
  5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier – and of course, it’ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you’re looking for jobs in data science.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge—and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.

  But the further AI advances, the more complex become the problems it needs to solve. And only Deep Learning can solve such complex problems and that's why it's at the heart of Artificial intelligence.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   --- Why DeepLearning A-Z? ---
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Here are five reasons we think Deep Learning A-Z™really is different, and stands out from the crowd ofother training programs out there:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   1. ROBUST STRUCTURE
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The first and most important thing we focused on is giving the course a robust structure. Deep Learning is very broad and complex and to navigate this maze you need a clear and global vision of it.
 </p>
 <p>
  That's why we grouped the tutorials into two volumes, representing the two fundamental branches of Deep Learning: Supervised Deep Learning and Unsupervised Deep Learning.With each volume focusing on three distinct algorithms, we found that this is the best structure for mastering Deep Learning.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   2. INTUITION TUTORIALS
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  So many courses and books just bombard you with the theory, and math, and coding... But they forget to explain, perhaps, the most important part:
  <strong>
   why you are doing what you are doing.
  </strong>
  And that's how this course is so different. We focus on developing an intuitive
  <em>
   *feel*
  </em>
  for the concepts behind Deep Learning algorithms.
 </p>
 <p>
  With our intuition tutorials you will be confident that you understand all the techniques on an instinctive level. And once you proceed to the hands-on coding exercises you will see for yourself how much more meaningful your experience will be.This is a game-changer.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   3. EXCITING PROJECTS
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Are you tired of courses based on over-used, outdated data sets?
 </p>
 <p>
  Yes? Well then you're in for a treat.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside this class we will work on Real-World datasets, to solve Real-World business problems. (Definitely not the boring iris or digit classification datasets that we see in every course). In this course we will solve six real-world challenges:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Artificial Neural Networks to solve a Customer Churn problem
  </li>
  <li>
   Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition
  </li>
  <li>
   RecurrentNeural Networks to predict Stock Prices
  </li>
  <li>
   Self-Organizing Maps to investigate Fraud
  </li>
  <li>
   Boltzmann Machines to create a Recomender System
  </li>
  <li>
   Stacked Autoencoders* to take on the challenge for the
   <strong>
    Netflix $1 Million prize
   </strong>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <em>
   *Stacked Autoencoders is a brand new technique in Deep Learning which didn't even exist a couple of years ago. We haven't seen this method explained anywhere else in sufficient depth.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   4. HANDS-ON CODING
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  InDeep Learning A-Z™ we code together with you.Every practical tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition, we will purposefully structure the code in such a way so that you can download it and apply it in your own projects.Moreover, we explain step-by-step where and how to modify the code to insert YOUR dataset, to tailor the algorithm to your needs, to get the output that you are after.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is a course which naturally extends into your career.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   5. IN-COURSE SUPPORT
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Have you ever taken a course or read a book where you have questions but cannot reach the author?
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, this course is different. We are fully committed to making this the most disruptive and powerful Deep Learning course on the planet. With that comes a responsibility to constantly be there when you need our help.
 </p>
 <p>
  In fact, since we physically also need to eat and sleep we have put together a team of professional Data Scientists to help us out. Whenever you ask a question you will get a response from us within 48 hours maximum.
 </p>
 <p>
  No matter how complex your query, we will be there.The bottom line is we want you to succeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   ---The Tools---
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Tensorflow and Pytorch are the two most popular open-source libraries for Deep Learning. In this course you will learn both!
 </p>
 <p>
  TensorFlow was developed by Google and is used in their speech recognition system, in the new google photos product, gmail, google search and much more. Companies using Tensorflow include AirBnb, Airbus, Ebay, Intel, Uber and dozens more.
 </p>
 <p>
  PyTorch is as just as powerful and is being developed by researchers at Nvidia and leading universities: Stanford, Oxford, ParisTech. Companies using PyTorch include Twitter, Saleforce and Facebook.
 </p>
 <p>
  So which is better and for what?
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, in this course you will have an opportunity to work with both and understand when Tensorflow is better and when PyTorch is the way to go. Throughout the tutorials we compare the two and give you tips and ideas on which could work best in certain circumstances.
 </p>
 <p>
  The interesting thing is that both these libraries are barely over 1 year old. That's what we mean when we say that in this course we teach you the most cutting edge Deep Learning models and techniques.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   --- MoreTools---
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Theano
  </em>
  is another open source deep learning library. It's very similar to Tensorflow in its functionality, but nevertheless we will still cover it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Keras
  </em>
  is an incredible library to implement Deep Learning models. It acts as a wrapper for Theano and Tensorflow. Thanks to Keras we can create powerful and complex Deep Learning models with only a few lines of code. This is what will allow you to have a global vision of what you are creating. Everything you make will look so clear and structured thanks to this library, that you will really get the intuition and understanding of what you are doing.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   --- Even MoreTools---
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Scikit-learn
  </em>
  the most practical Machine Learning library. We will mainly use it:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   to evaluate the performance of our models with the most relevant technique, k-Fold Cross Validation
  </li>
  <li>
   to improve our models with effective Parameter Tuning
  </li>
  <li>
   to preprocess our data, so that our models can learn in the best conditions
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  And of course, we have to mention the usual suspects. This whole course is based on Python and in every single section you will be getting hours and hours of invaluable hands-on practical coding experience.
 </p>
 <p>
  Plus, throughout the course we will be usingNumpy to do high computations and manipulate high dimensional arrays,Matplotlib to plot insightful charts andPandas to import and manipulate datasets the most efficiently.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   --- Who Is This Course For?---
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  As you can see, there are lots of different tools in the space of Deep Learning and in this course we make sure to show you the most important and most progressive ones so that when you're done with Deep Learning A-Z™ your skills are on the cutting edge of today's technology.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   If you are just starting out into Deep Learning,
  </strong>
  then you will find this course extremely useful. Deep Learning A-Z™ is structured around special coding blueprint approaches meaning that you won't get bogged down in unnecessary programming or mathematical complexities and instead you will be applying Deep Learning techniques from very early on in the course.You will build your knowledge from the ground up and you will see how with every tutorial you are getting more and more confident.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   If you already have experience with Deep Learning,
  </strong>
  you will find this course refreshing, inspiring and very practical. Inside Deep Learning A-Z™ you will master some of the most cutting-edge Deep Learning algorithms and techniques (some of which didn't even exist a year ago) and through this course you will gain an immense amount of valuable hands-on experience with real-world business challenges. Plus, inside you will find inspiration to explore new Deep Learning skills and applications.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   ---Real-World Case Studies ---
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Mastering Deep Learning is not just about knowing the intuition and tools, it's also about being able to apply these models to real-world scenarios and derive actual measurable results for the business or project. That's why in this course we are introducing six exciting challenges:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   #1 Churn Modelling Problem
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  In this part you will be solving a data analytics challenge for a bank. You will be given a dataset with a large sample of the bank's customers. To make this dataset, the bank gathered information such as customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, etc. During a period of 6 months, the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the bank.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your goal is to make an Artificial Neural Network that can predict, based on geo-demographical and transactional information given above, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (customer churn). Besides, you are asked to rank all the customers of the bank, based on their probability of leaving. To do that, you will need to use the right Deep Learning model, one that is based on a probabilistic approach.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you succeed in this project, you will create significant added value to the bank. By applying your Deep Learning model the bank may significantly reduce customer churn.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   #2 Image Recognition
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  In this part, you will create a Convolutional Neural Network that is able to detect various objects in images. We will implement this Deep Learning model to recognize a cat or a dog in a set of pictures. However, this model can be reused to detect anything else and we will show you how to do it - by simply changing the pictures in the input folder.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, you will be able to train the same model on a set of brain images, to detect if they contain a tumor or not. But if you want to keep it fitted to cats and dogs, then you will literally be able to a take a picture of your cat or your dog, and your model will predict which pet you have. We even tested it out on Hadelin’s dog!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   #3Stock Price Prediction
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  In this part, you will create one of the most powerful Deep Learning models. We will even go as far as saying that you will create the Deep Learning model closest to
  <em>
   “Artificial Intelligence”
  </em>
  . Why is that? Because this model will have long-term memory, just like us, humans.
 </p>
 <p>
  The branch of Deep Learning which facilitates this is Recurrent Neural Networks. Classic RNNs have short memory, and were neither popular nor powerful for this exact reason. But a recent major improvement in Recurrent Neural Networks gave rise to the popularity of LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory RNNs) which has completely changed the playing field.We are extremely excited to include these cutting-edge deep learning methods in our course!
 </p>
 <p>
  In this part you will learn how to implement this ultra-powerful model, and we will take the challenge to use it to predict the real Google stock price. A similar challenge has already been faced by researchers at Stanford University and we will aim to do at least as good as them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   #4Fraud Detection
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  According to a recent report published by Markets &amp; Markets the Fraud Detection and Prevention Market is going to be worth $33.19 Billion USD by 2021. This is a huge industry and the demand for advanced Deep Learning skills is only going to grow. That’s why we have included this case study in the course.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is the first part of Volume 2 - Unsupervised Deep Learning Models. The business challenge here is about detecting fraud in credit card applications. You will be creating a Deep Learning model for a bank and you are given a dataset that contains information on customers applying for an advanced credit card.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is the data that customers provided when filling the application form. Your task is to detect potential fraud within these applications. That means that by the end of the challenge, you will literally come up with an explicit list of customers who potentially cheated on their applications.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   #5 &amp; 6 Recommender Systems
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  From Amazon product suggestions to Netflix movie recommendations - good recommender systems are very valuable in today's World. And specialists who can create them are some of the top-paid Data Scientists on the planet.
 </p>
 <p>
  We will work on a dataset that has exactly the same features as the Netflix dataset: plenty of movies, thousands of users, who have rated the movies they watched. The ratings go from 1 to 5, exactly like in the Netflix dataset, which makes the Recommender System more complex to build than if the ratings were simply “Liked” or “Not Liked”.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your final Recommender System will be able to predict the ratings of the movies the customers didn’t watch. Accordingly, by ranking the predictions from 5 down to 1, your Deep Learning model will be able to recommend which movies each user should watch. Creating such a powerful Recommender System is quite a challenge so we will give ourselves two shots. Meaning we will build it with two different Deep Learning models.
 </p>
 <p>
  Our first model will be Deep Belief Networks, complex Boltzmann Machines that will be covered in Part 5. Then our second model will be with the powerful AutoEncoders, my personal favorites. You will appreciate the contrast between their simplicity, and what they are capable of.
 </p>
 <p>
  And you will even be able to apply it to yourself or your friends. The list of movies will be explicit so you will simply need to rate the movies you already watched, input your ratings in the dataset, execute your model and voila! The Recommender System will tell you exactly which movies you would love one night you if are out of ideas of what to watch on Netflix!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   ---Summary---
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  In conclusion, this is an exciting training program filled with intuition tutorials, practical exercises and real-World case studies.
 </p>
 <p>
  We are super enthusiastic about Deep Learning and hope to see you inside the class!

  <strong>
   <em>
    realized how good this course

  </strong>
  <em>
   was. This course taught me more than I was expecting, it provided great instructions and a lot of hands-on tasks to drill-in the concept."" - Marc

   Are you trying to choose between all the different iOS courses on Udemy? Take a look at what students on my course had to say about this:

  <em>
   I have revamped my expectation for what a
  </em>
  <strong>
   <em>
    5 star course
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   should be for Udemy. Angela, you're awesome! I already rated the course as 5 stars early on (at about 20% completion), but after completing roughly 70% of the course, I can say this is my favourite Udemy course as of today. Brilliant course Angela!
  </em>

   ""I have taken several iOS courses, so far this course had the
  </em>
  <strong>

   on swift and xcode documentation. The lecturer is kinda humorous sometimes which make this course even more enjoyable."" - Bryan Pukanda

  </strong>
  <em>
   . It is like one of those movies that you wish keeps going. Whatever concepts are covered were covered very beautifully and made learning quite simple. I got so many answers to Why? in this course like how closures work and why they work that way... why delegates work that way. Thank you so much for this course."" - Arun Lakhera
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   ""I compare this to another top iOS class on Udemy, but I think that this one beats it. The reason? Angela doesn't show you a plethora of material and then say that we will discuss this later, or say ""just do this. You will see why later."" She goes into the

  <strong>
   <em>
    reason for doing something

   Do you have some experience developing iOS apps and wonder if this course is for you? Take a look at what students on my course had to say about this:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   ""This is the best-organized course for starting Swift that I've seen. The course is excellent for teaching Swift programming including vital information using Xcode, Github, Cocoapods, Stack Overflow, Alamofire, Firebase, REST APIs and all the services commonly used by app developers. They show all the ways of using Xcode and other services that took me months to learn willy nilly.
  </em>
  <strong>
   <em>
    Wish I had this course a year ago
   </em>
  </strong>
  <em>
   but even with a year of Swift experience I still found a lot of great information and helpful tips. Love all the extras the course provides especially the assets(graphics, sound files, etc) for practice projects as I'm always taking too much time to find some assets to play with. This course understands how to teach programmers by giving them the toolsets and abilities they need to build apps. The course teaches the foundation of the language as well as skills to build your knowledge and improve your troubleshooting skills. Angela is a wonderful speaker and should do the voiceovers on everyone's instructional videos, seriously. :)"" - Marcy Vernon
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   ""Def. an amazing and awesome class for learning iOS programming. I've been coding for years and taken many programming related classes on Udemy and this is def. one of the best. The instructor walks you through all the in's and out's of developing apps for the iOS platform.

 <p>
  <strong>
   It's time to show Excel who's boss.
  </strong>
  Whether you're starting from square one or aspiring to become an absolute Excel power user, you've come to the right place.
 </p>
 <p>
  This course will give you a deep understanding of the advanced Excel formulas and functions that transform Excel from a basic spreadsheet program into a dynamic and powerful analytics tool.
 </p>
 <p>
  While most Excel courses focus on simply
  <em>
   what
  </em>
  <strong>
  </strong>
  each formula does, I teach through
  <strong>
   hands-on, contextual examples
  </strong>
  designed to showcase
  <em>
   why
  </em>
  <strong>
  </strong>
  these formulas are awesome and
  <em>
   how
  </em>
  they can be applied in a number of ways. I will not train you to regurgitate functions and formula syntax; I will teach you how to THINK like Excel.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   By the end of the course you'll be writing robust, elegant formulas from scratch, allowing you to:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Easily build dynamic tools &amp; Excel dashboards to filter, display and analyze your data
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Create your own formula-based Excel formatting rules
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Join datasets from multiple sources with XLOOKUP, INDEX &amp;MATCH functions
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Manipulate dates, times, text, and arrays
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Automate tedious and time-consuming tasks using cell formulas and functions in Excel (no VBA required!)
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Pull real-time data from APIs directly into Excel
    <em>
     (weather, stock quotes, directions, etc.)
    </em>
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   We'll dive into a broad range of Excel formulas &amp; functions, including:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Lookup/Reference functions
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Statistical functions
   </p>

  You'll learn about your camera settings (DSLR, mirrorless, or other), including how to shoot in manual mode. You'll use stabilization tools and master how to properly compose and light a scene. You'll even learn how to take great photos with a smartphone or tablet and how to edit images.

  HTML5 is one of the hot web technologies and is widely gaining acceptance across mobile and web. In our course, you get a complete resource that can get you started on application development for HTML5. In our course, you work on actual examples and go through important concepts required for thorough knowledge.
 </p>
 <p>
  In our course, you will start with basic HTML tags. You will learn how to create HTML websites and use CSS in your work before we start discussing HTML5. We do not assume any prior knowledge so we go through the concepts from the beginner's point of view. In our HTML5 lectures, we start with new tags and forms. We then gradually move to advance topics like Drag and Drop and Multimedia. We follow it with difficult topics like Geolocation, WebStorage, and Application cache. This course creates easy to grasp examples for each of the concepts and by the end of it, you will be able to understand the complete picture rather than just bits and pieces of the technology. Some of the salient features for the course are:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Designed for absolute beginners
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Practical tips and tricks for the real world development
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Updated to include modern concepts
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    It shows how to think in HTML
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>

   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  This is the complete HTML5 course you will need to get started with HTML5 application development. The simplicity and its content have made it one of the most popular HTML5 courses on the planet.

   What Is Spring Boot?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Spring Boot is the modern development approach for building enterprise application. Spring Boot minimizes the configuration required for setting up Spring projects. By using Spring Boot, you can accelerate your development speed and leverage the auto-configuration features. This course covers the latest version of Spring Boot 3.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What Is Spring?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Spring is an enterprise Java framework. It was designed to simplify Jakarta EE development and make developers more productive. Spring makes use of Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection to promote good software coding practices and speed up development time. This course covers the latest version of Spring 6.
 </p>
 <p>
  This course covers Spring Core, Annotations, All Java Spring Configuration, Spring AOP, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring REST, Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What Is Hibernate/JPA?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Hibernate/JPA is an Object-to-Relational-Mapping (ORM) framework. It simplifies database access for Java applications. By using the framework, you can easily store and retrieve Java objects by setting up some simple configuration mappings.
 </p>
 <p>
  This course covers basic Hibernate/JPA CRUD. Also, advanced Hibernate/JPA mappings are covered for one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many.

  Beware of other Udemy Spring/Hibernate courses. Most of them are outdated and use old versions of Spring and Hibernate. Don’t waste your time or money on learning outdated technology.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, I create all of the
  <strong>
   code from scratch in this course
  </strong>
  . Beware of other courses, those instructors simply copy/paste from their github repo or they use pre-written code. Their approach is not ideal for real-time learning.
 </p>
 <p>
  Take
  <strong>
   my course
  </strong>
  where I show you how to
  <strong>
   create all of the code from scratch
  </strong>
  . You can
  <strong>
   type the code along with me in the videos
  </strong>
  , which is the
  <strong>
   best way to learn
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  I am a
  <strong>
   very responsive instructor
  </strong>
  and I am available to
  <strong>
   answer your questions
  </strong>
  and help you work through any problems.
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, all source code is provided with the course along with setup instructions.

   <em>
    He's made Spring Boot for CRUD applications with Thymeleaf very easy to follow and learn

   QUESTION: What If You Could Get Twice As Much Done Tomorrow As You HaveAny Day This Year?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Six years ago, I was sitting in the passenger seat of acar with my friend.
 </p>
 <p>
  My friend turns to me and says""It's incredible how much I've gotten done in thisyear! So much has changed.""
 </p>
 <p>
  And all Icould do is smile. Becausefor me, almostnothinghad changed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The truth is that we all want to use your time well. But in order to do so, you need to know certain principles you'll never learn in school.
 </p>
 <p>
  I didn't want to face another year where nothing changed. That's why I went after the answers. And it's also why I made this course.
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside, I'm going to share with you 7 specific steps you can take today to become more productive, taken from my course How To Double Your Productivity By Tomorrow Morning. If you take these ideas and apply them, I think you'll become more productive than you ever have before.
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  Here's a sample of what you'll learn inside:
 </p>

 </p>
 <p>
  ""Course starts out with basic commands and works through more advanced commands as it progresses. The course then goes through add on software and applications following demonstrates basic usages of that application. It was easy to follow along on my personal install of Ubuntu by pausing/review the tutorial as needed. I suggest this method than just sitting and watching the course all the way through. This course is much easier than just reading books. Recommend to friends who just started out in Ubuntu.""

  Bem-vindo ou bem-vinda, é um prazer te receber no curso de Android!

  O curso começa com Introdução à computação e introdução à lógica de programação para pessoas que não possuam experiência em programação.

 </p>
 <p>
  Posteriormente é feita a instalação do Android Studio e começamos com a prática de desenvolvimento de aplicações. As aplicações Android serão criadas do zero sem cópia de código para que seja possível entender toda a teoria para o desenvolvimento. Será feito a manipulação dos elementos de interface, customização e criação da lógica das aplicações.

  Alguns dos assuntos cobertos:

   <p>
    Alteração do ícone da aplicação
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    SharedPreferences e navegação entre Activities
   </p>
   <p>
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Para as aplicações, usaremos
  <strong>
   Android Studio 3.4
  </strong>
  e versões mais recentes do Android!

   Updated to Python 3.11.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A Course to Learn Both the Theory and Real-World Skills
   <br/>
  </strong>
  This is the only course you need to learn both the theoretical and practical aspects of Python. It is ideal for people who do not have a programming background. By the end of the course, you will have a portfolio of Python apps on your GitHub account. You will learn Python by building 20 apps together with the instructor and solve 10 independent Python projects. This will help you code independently and apply for a junior developer job after finishing the course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Multimodal Learning
   <br/>
  </strong>
  The course follows a proven multimodal learning approach that offers students a video course and an environment that simulates real-world programming activities similar to an on-site bootcamp. Students learn Python by building programs from scratch, adding new features to existing programs, improving existing features, fixing bugs, engaging in code experiments, learning programming tools that every programmer should know, deploying apps in the cloud, and interacting with other fellow students. Your skill set will progressively and strongly build up as you build your programming portfolio to list and showcase all your Python projects.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   A Course for Absolute Beginners
   <br/>
  </strong>
  This course is perfect for those who have never programmed before. It covers every Python concept using real-world examples, making it easy to understand both the Python language and the logic behind programming. From the basics to the advanced features like threading, everything is introduced in the context of a real-world application that you will build. This approach will make abstract programming concepts easy to grasp.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Instructor-Led and Independent Student Projects
   <br/>
  </strong>
  In this course, you will build programs daily to develop your skills. Each day, you will work on projects led by your instructor and then work on projects independently to solidify your skills. At the end of the day, you can compare your code with the instructor's code to identify and address any gaps in your understanding.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Career Change or App Development
   <br/>
  </strong>
  If you're considering a career change to become a Python programmer or looking to turn your idea into a real app, this course is perfect for you. You can take the full course to become a programmer or pick specific projects that interest you if you only want to build a particular app. Additionally, you will learn Git and GitHub so that you can create a portfolio of 20 Python apps on your GitHub account, which you can show to potential employers or share with friends.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   From Data Science to Web Development
   <br/>
  </strong>
  This course covers a wide range of applications, from creating rich data science web apps that analyze and visualize large amounts of data to building web applications using Python web frameworks such as Streamlit, Flask, and Django. It also covers other aspects of Python, such as automating tedious tasks, ranging from generating PDF invoices to automating emails. In short, this course offers a comprehensive approach to Python, covering various domains, making it an all-in-one solution.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Flexible Learning Schedule
  </strong>
  <br/>
  This curriculum is designed to accommodate your schedule. While it is recommended that you study 2-5 hours every day, you can also work through multiple-day modules during the weekend or whenever it is convenient for you. You will also have unlimited access to all the videos and practice activities. By committing to this course, you will be able to achieve better results than a 10,000-dollar boot camp.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Boosted Focus
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Keeping yourself focused and motivated with online courses is hard, but not with this course. The course is designed around real-world projects and challenges to keep students interested throughout the entire course. This is a course that you will actually finish.

  <em>
   - ""If you don’t know where to start I suggest you start here.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   The course provides a hands-on approach to learning and applying the basics from the start. A large number of libraries and tools are introduced in an organised way. The teacher is knowledgeable and engaging.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Python offers so many possibilities, but Ardit has managed to pull a good selection together that allows you to gain an insight into what you can do.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   I enjoyed the broad spectrum of the many topics: Streamlit webapps, basic data plotting, graphical user interfaces, create pdfs, data analysis with pandas, web scraping, Jupyter, API keys, sql and more. Always using them, building something, not just theory.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   And you don’t just learn the syntax, you learn how to set up your working environment, how to approach and plan an application, how to troubleshoot and debug, how to improve your code, where and how to find answers to solve problems.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   The only thing that frustrated me somewhat, was that the concept and implementation of Object Orientated Programming could possibly have been introduced earlier in the course. Understanding just the very basics greatly improves your overall insight, which in turn, aides your learning.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   Although I would not say that finishing this course makes for job-ready developer, I do feel it gives you a solid foundation and it prepares you well for a deeper dive into your chosen, or even newly discovered, field of interest.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   All in all, it shows that a great deal of effort has been put in the creation of this course. It is currently even further expanded and I’m looking forward to even more content. A big thank you to Ardit for putting together such a great course.""

   Course is set for 60 ""days"". I would say each day takes 3-4 hours. Entire course took me about 2 months. Course starts with Python basics and then you build several apps which highlight the major uses of Python, including command line apps, GUI apps, web applications, and databases. I would suggest you print out the code and keep as a reference for yor future projects. Also, follow along by trying all the code yourself and the student projects so you relly learn.

 Learn Node.js by building real-world applications with Node JS, Express, MongoDB, Jest, and more!
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <b>
  What you'll learn:
 </b>
 <br/>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Completely refilmed for 3rd edition
  </li>
  <li>
   Build, test, and launch Node apps
  </li>
  <li>
   Create Express web servers and APIs

  </li>
 </ul>
 <br/>
 <p>
  Have you tried to learn Node before? You start a new course, and the instructor has you installing a bunch of libraries before you even know what Node is or how it works. You eventually get stuck and reach out to the instructor, but you get no reply. You then close the course and never open it again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sound familiar?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   I created this course to be what I wanted when I was learning Node.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The Complete Node.js Developer Course covers the fundamentals of Node before diving deep into great tools like Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB.
 </p>
 <p>
  The entire course is based around a single goal: Turning you into a professional Node developer capable of developing, testing, and deploying real-world production applications.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   The best way to learn Node is by building Node apps.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  From the very start you’ll be programming every project and working through challenges that I’ve designed to reinforce what you’ve learned. This will give you the hands-on experience necessary to be able to create and launch your own project once you’re done.
 </p>
 <p>
  You’ll be building four projects:
 </p>
 <p>
  1. A note-taking app to get your feet wet
 </p>
 <p>
  2. A weather application that interacts with the MapBox and Dark Sky APIs
 </p>
 <p>
  3. A task manager REST API complete with user accounts and authentication
 </p>
 <p>
  4. A real-time chat app with a client-side companion
 </p>
 <p>
  By the end, you’ll be able to take what you’ve learned and launch your own Node application.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   When learning, learn the latest.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  I work to keep this course full of the most up-to-date Node material out there. This course is compatible with the latest Node.js version.
 </p>
 <p>
  You’re getting access to hot-off-the-press features.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Everything you need comes in one easy-to-use package.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  You can stop worrying if you're learning the right skills to build an app or land a new job. I've curated all the tech that's essential to building real-world apps. I've mapped out everything in a comprehensive, easy-to-follow package designed to get you up and running in a few weeks.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   There’s no better time to learn Node.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the 2016 Stack Overflow Survey, Node is in the top ten for back-end popularity and back-end salary, with an average salary of $85k. This means more jobs and more opportunities for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   You might get stuck. But I’m here to help.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  There’s nothing worse than getting five hours into a course, getting stuck, and not getting the help you need to continue.
 </p>
 <p>
  I’m in the Q&amp;A everyday to help you get unstuck. I reply to every question to get you back on track.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Don’t take my word for it. Check the reviews and see what other students are saying.
  </strong>

   Why learn a JavaScript course?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The most obvious reason for learning JavaScript is if you have hopes of becoming a web developer. Even if you haven’t got your heart set on a tech career, being proficient in JavaScript will enable you to build websites from scratch—a pretty useful skill to have in today’s job market!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1)
  <strong>
   JavaScript experts are versatile -
  </strong>
  JavaScript is an extremely versatile language. Once you’ve mastered JavaScript, the possibilities are endless: you can code on the client-side (frontend) using Angular and on the server-side (backend) using Node.js. You can also develop web, mobile, and desktop apps using React, React Native, and Electron, and you can even get involved in machine learning.
 </p>
 <p>
  2)
  <strong>
   JavaScript experts are in-demand (and well-paid) -
  </strong>
  JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world, so it’s no wonder that JavaScript is one of the most sought-after skills in the web development industry today. The global demand for JavaScript seems to outweigh the expertise available on the market. According to this HackerRank report, 48% of employers worldwide need developers with JavaScript skills, while only 42% of student developers claim to be proficient in JavaScript.
 </p>
 <p>
  3)
  <strong>
   JavaScript is beginner-friendly -
  </strong>
  Compared to many other programming languages, JavaScript offers one of the more beginner-friendly entry points into the world of coding. The great thing about JavaScript is that it comes installed on every modern web browser—there’s no need to set up any kind of development environment, which means you can start coding with JavaScript right away!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Another advantage of learning
  <strong>
   JavaScript
  </strong>
  as your first programming language is that you get instant feedback; with a minimal amount of JavaScript code, you’ll immediately see visible results. There’s also a huge JavaScript community on sites like Stack Overflow, so you’ll find plenty of support as you learn. Not only is JavaScript beginner-friendly; it will also set you up with some extremely valuable transferable skills. JavaScript supports object-oriented, functional, and imperative styles of programming—
  <strong>
   skills that can be transferred to any new language you might learn later on, such as Python, Java, or C++.
  </strong>
  <strong>
   JavaScript
  </strong>
  provides a crucial introduction to key principles and practices that you’ll take with you throughout your career as a developer.

  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>

  If you’re an absolute beginner or you’re already at an intermediate level, the course will advance your current drawing ability to a professional level. The course is a comprehensive 10 module guided video course, where the only limit to your progression is your determination and engagement in the rewarding assignments.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether you want to draw characters, design characters, create concept art characters for films and games, illustrations, comics, manga, Disney style or other styles,
  <strong>
   this is
   <em>
    the
   </em>
   course you need to get you there.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Clear, Easy to Understand Lessons (Scott's No Fluff Promise!)

   Assignments that are Rewarding

  Bridging the gap between theory and practice, each module’s assignments have been designed to both reinforce theory, and feel rewarding. I’ve taken the core of the theory, and purpose built each assignment to help you rapidly progress, and you’ll see the difference in your own work almost immediately. Art is about doing, so let’s get started- let’s draw something awesome!

   ""Amazing course. I haven't even started drawing yet because I'm in awe of how simple the instructor makes even the most complicated techniques look. At last, drawing like a pro is within my grasp! I also like the fact that the instructor allows me to just watch the first time through without worrying about drawing until I'm familiar with the concepts. My next time through the course, I'll be prepared and more confident than ever to begin drawing. Even so, I've already used some of the concepts in this course for a sketch here and there when I feel inspired to draw, and I can tell worlds of difference between my former drawings and newer ones. Laid back instructor, but very knowledgeable. I highly recommend this course.""

 </p>
 <p>
  This is the ultimate course to learn how to deploy
  <em>
   any
  </em>
  web application you can possibly dream up. Docker and Kubernetes are the newest tech in the Dev Ops world, and have dramatically changed the flow of creating and deploying web apps. Docker is a technology that allows applications to run in constructs called 'containers', while Kubernetes allows for many different 'containers' to run in coordination.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Docker from Scratch!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  In this course you'll
  <strong>
   learn Docker from absolute fundamentals
  </strong>
  , beginning by learning the answer to basic questions such as ""What is a container?"" and ""How does a container work?"". From the very first few lectures, we will do a
  <strong>
   deep dive on the inner workings of containers
  </strong>
  , so you get a core understanding of exactly how they are implemented. Once you understand what a container is, you'll learn how to work with them using basic Docker CLIcommands. After that, you'll apply your new-found mastery of the Docker CLI to build your own custom images, effectively 'Dockerizing' your own personal applications.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   CI +CDPipelines
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, no course on Docker would be complete without a full understanding of common Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment patterns. You will learn how to implement
  <strong>
   a full CI + CDworkflow
  </strong>
  using Github, Travis CI, and Amazon Web Services, creating a pipeline that
  <strong>
   automatically deploys your code
  </strong>
  every time you push your latest changes to Github!
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Multi-Container Deployments onAWS!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  After building a deployment pipeline, you'll apply it to master both single-container and multi-container
  <strong>
   deployments on Amazon Web Services.
  </strong>
  You will construct a multi-container application utilizing
  <strong>
   Node, React, Redis, and Postgres
  </strong>
  , and see the amazing power of containers in action (Note: all Javascript coding in this course is optional, the full source code is provided if you don't want to write JS).
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Kubernetes!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Finally, you will tackle Kubernetes, a production-grade system for managing complex applications with many different running containers. You will learn the
  <strong>
   right way to build a Kubernetes Cluster
  </strong>
  - this course doesn't have any of those annoying
  <em>
   ""don't do this in production""
  </em>
  comments! You will first build a Kubernetes Cluster on your local machine, then eventually move it over to a cloud provider. You'll even learn how to
  <strong>
   set up HTTPS on Kubernetes
  </strong>
  , which is harder than it sounds!

  The only way to effectively learn HTML5 and CSS3 is by diving right in and building websites from the ground up. That’s exactly what this course does. Designed for complete beginners, you’ll create a complete website section by section during 35 lectures and 5 hours of content.
 </p>
 <p>
  You’ll start by becoming familiar with HTML tags and how they’re used, followed by the use of attributes and common settings. Once you’ve got a handle on basic HTML, you’ll move on to the fun stuff: CSS. You’ll use CSS for fonts, colours, lists, navigation menus, and more, adding a new element to your website with each section. Links, layouts, tables, forms and videos are all covered too.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you know how to use a web browser and a text editor, you’re all set up for this course already. No extra software or tools are needed, and you can choose your preferred option of each to get going. By the time you finish, you’ll know everything you need to know to create beautiful, functional, easy to use websites of any kind.

   About HTML5 and CSS3
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  HTML5
 </p>
 <p>
  HTML or Hyper Text Mark-up Language is the language used for presenting websites and web content. HTML5 is the latest version, made official by the World Wide Web Consortium in 2014. Having a good grasp of HTML means you’ll be able to create, present and edit a whole variety of content on the web.
 </p>
 <p>
  CSS3
 </p>
 <p>
  CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) essentially ‘enhances’ HTML, giving developers and users more control over how pages and content is displayed. It is responsible for creating more visually engaging web pages, applications and interfaces. CSS3 is the latest version, and has many more extended features than previous versions – although it is backwards compatible.

 <p>
  Have you ever wondered how the webpages you visit daily come to life? How does a seemingly simple combination of text and images create an interactive and dynamic user experience? The answer lies in the trinity of web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Together, these three technologies form the backbone of modern web design and development, enabling the creation of engaging, accessible, and responsive websites.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In this introductory course, we will delve into the essentials of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a solid foundation for aspiring web developers. By the end of this course, you will have a strong understanding of these technologies and be well-equipped to embark on your journey in web development.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   HTML: The Structure of the Web
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the cornerstone of any webpage. At its core, HTML provides the basic structure and content of a webpage. It uses a system of tags and attributes to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. These tags act as containers for content, allowing developers to create a meaningful and organized layout for their webpages.
 </p>
 <p>
  As you begin your study of HTML, you will learn about the key elements that make up the structure of a webpage. These include the doctype declaration, the html element, head and body elements, and a variety of content-specific tags. You will also explore semantic HTML, which emphasizes the use of meaningful tags to convey the purpose and structure of content, ultimately making the web more accessible and search-engine friendly.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   CSS: Styling the Web
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  While HTML provides the foundation of a webpage, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) brings it to life with style and flair. CSS is a stylesheet language that allows developers to control the visual presentation of HTML elements, including colors, fonts, layout, and even animations. By separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), developers can create consistent and maintainable designs across multiple webpages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Throughout this course, you will explore various CSS properties and selectors that allow you to target and style specific HTML elements. We will cover topics such as the box model, positioning, typography, and responsive design principles. You will learn how to create external stylesheets, enabling you to easily apply consistent styles to multiple webpages. Ultimately, you will gain an understanding of how to create visually appealing and accessible web designs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   JavaScript: Interactivity and Dynamic Content
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  The final piece of the web development puzzle is JavaScript, a powerful and versatile programming language. JavaScript breathes life into your webpages by enabling interactivity, dynamic content, and real-time updates. With JavaScript, you can create responsive user interfaces, validate user input, and even build complete web applications.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In this section of the course, you will learn the fundamentals of JavaScript, including variables, data types, functions, and control structures. You will explore the Document Object Model (DOM), a programming interface that allows JavaScript to interact with and manipulate HTML and CSS. Additionally, you will gain insight into key concepts such as event handling, asynchronous programming, and AJAX.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By understanding how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS, you will have the ability to create dynamic and engaging web experiences that respond to user input and adapt to different devices and screen sizes.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   Putting It All Together
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  As you progress through this course, you will work on various hands-on projects that will help solidify your understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects will challenge you to apply the concepts you have learned, allowing you to create functional and visually appealing webpages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  By the end of this foundational course, you will be well-prepared to tackle more advanced web development topics, such as responsive design, accessibility, performance optimization, and even server-side programming. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the possibilities are endless as you continue to explore and expand your web development skills.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The skills you acquire in this course will open doors to a wide range of opportunities, whether you're interested in pursuing a career in web development, enhancing your current profession, or simply exploring a new hobby. With dedication and practice, you can become a proficient web developer, capable of creating modern, engaging, and accessible websites that cater to the ever-evolving digital landscape.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  In summary, this course will provide you with a comprehensive introduction to the essential building blocks of web development: HTML for content and structure, CSS for presentation and styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic content. Together, these technologies empower you to create captivating web experiences that delight users and achieve your digital objectives.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So, are you ready to begin your journey into the world of web development? Let's get started and lay the foundations for your success in the exciting and rapidly evolving digital realm.

 <p>
  Learn Network Programmability and Network Automation using GNS3 and Python version 3.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   This course is based on Python 3.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Want to program networks using Python, but not sure where to start? Well, this course will show you how you can start
  <strong>
   programming Cisco networks within 20 minutes.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  This course was created for network engineers. There are too many other Python courses out there that try to make network engineers software developers. Instead of teaching network automation, they teach you Python theory. This course is different.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   This course is practical.
  </strong>
  I won't talk about programming in abstract terms and make you wait before you can start automating networks. I will show you how you can quickly and easily start network programming by using GNS3, Cisco IOS and Python.
 </p>
 <p>
  You will see demonstrations of the configuration of both Cisco routers and switches in GNS3. For example, how to configure multiple VLANs on a multiple switches, or how to configure OSPF on a router and more.
 </p>
 <p>
  This course shows you practical examples of using Python to programmatically configure Cisco network devices rather then just talking about it.
 </p>
 <p>
  The days of configuring Cisco networks only with the command line interface (CLI) are drawing to a close. You need to add network programmability using Python and APIs to your skill set.

  If you are a business manager or an executive, or a student who wants to learn and apply machine learning, R and predictive modelling in Real world problems of business, this course will give you a solid base for that by teaching you the most popular techniques of machine learning, R and predictive modelling.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why should you choose this course?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  This course covers all the steps that one should take while solving a business problem through linear regression. This course will give you an in-depth understanding of machine learning and predictive modelling techniques using R.
 </p>
 <p>
  Most courses only focus on teaching how to run the analysis but we believe that what happens before and after running analysis is even more important i.e. before running analysis it is very important that you have the right data and do some pre-processing on it. And after running analysis, you should be able to judge how good your model is and interpret the results to actually be able to help your business.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>

 </p>
 <p>
  Below is a list of popular FAQs of students who want to start their Machine learning journey-
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What is Machine Learning?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Machine Learning is a field of computer science which gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  You can divide your learning process into 3 parts:
 </p>
 <p>
  Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.
 </p>
 <p>
  Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model
 </p>
 <p>
  Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python
 </p>
 <p>
  Understanding of models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why use R for Machine Learning?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R
 </p>
 <p>
  1. It’s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it’s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R than Python. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind.
 </p>
 <p>
  3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. As compared to Python, R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science.
 </p>
 <p>
  4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, usage of R and Python has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it’s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.
 </p>
 <p>
  5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Like Python, adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier – and of course, it’ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you’re looking for jobs in data science.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What are the major advantages of using R over Python?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    As compared to Python, R has a higher user base and the biggest number of statistical packages and libraries available. Although, Python has almost all features that analysts need, R triumphs over Python.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    R is a function-based language, whereas Python is object-oriented. If you are coming from a purely statistical background and are not looking to take over major software engineering tasks when productizing your models, R is an easier option, than Python.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    R has more data analysis functionality built-in than Python, whereas Python relies on Packages
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Python has main packages for data analysis tasks, R has a larger ecosystem of small packages
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Graphics capabilities are generally considered better in R than in Python
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    R has more statistical support in general than Python
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge—and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.
 </p>
 <p>
  Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.

 Code Your Very Own Dynamic Websites by Learning PHP Through Real-World Application &amp; Examples
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <b>
  What you'll learn:
 </b>
 <br/>
 <ul>
  <li>
   By the end of this course, you will have a thorough understanding of the PHP fundamentals
  </li>
  <li>
   Upon completion, you will have coded a handful of useful dynamic PHP examples
  </li>
  <li>
   In the last section of this course, you focus on building a dynamic website for a restaurant
  </li>
  <li>
   By the end of this course, you will be so excited about your newly acquired PHP skills and want to start converting all your websites to PHP!

 <p>
  <strong>
   Learn How to Code Dynamic Websites with PHP 5+
  </strong>
  <em>
   for absolute beginners!
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  This course is a total beginners guide to coding dynamic websites with PHP so you need
  <em>
   no prior knowledge or experience with PHP —
  </em>
  although, it is a good idea if you know
  <em>
   some
  </em>
  HTML &amp; CSS.
  <em>
   (My beginner's guide Build a Website from Scratch with HTML &amp; CSS will teach you everything you need to know about HTML &amp; CSS.)
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Practical Hands-on Approach
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  My approach with this course, like many of my courses, is to take a practical ""hands on"" approach. While there will be some theory involved — every single lesson requires you to get your hands dirty and exercise what you've learned in that specific lesson. I find this to be the best approach, because you're able to retain much more of what you learned, and therefore, get up and running with maximizing your practical knowledge of PHP quickly!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why Should I Learn PHP?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  So — why learn PHP? Well, PHP is a very powerful scripting language used by millions of websites. Some of the most popular websites and frameworks utilize PHP to build their dynamic websites. PHP works very well with HTML, and therefore will allow you to start coding dynamic websites quickly without having to learn some of the more complicated scripting languages out there.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   You Will Love This Course
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  I think you're going to love this course, and you're going to especially love what you're going to learn. When I first started learning PHP, I
  <em>
   couldn't wait
  </em>
  to start implementing what I learned into my websites! I think you'll feel the same.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   It's Totally Free!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, I am excited to be offering this course
  <em>
   absolutely free
  </em>
  for three reasons:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <p>
    I don't want a purchasing decision to get in the way of you learning what I have to offer in this course.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    I want as many people as possible to be able access the content.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    I want to give you learning material so good that it
    <em>
     should
    </em>
    cost money.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  <strong>
   The Final Project
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Throughout the course you will be building a handful of dynamic PHP examples, but in the last section of the course, we will build a dynamic website for a (fictional) restaurant.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, I invite you to join me in learning how to Code Dynamic Websites with PHP!
 </p>
 <p>
  Let's do this.

 </p>
 <p>
  Before starting the creation of this course, our team attentively investigated feedbacks for existing courses on the Udemy platform and tried to focus on the feedbacks for the top-rated courses to understand what can be improved in this course and make it, even more, better from the quality standpoint. After analysis, we understand what will help students to learn Java in a more efficient way. In this course:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   - High concentration of useful material in each lesson
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching other 30 minutes lessons.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes
  <strong>
   <em>
    10 times as much (sometimes even 20)
   </em>
  </strong>
  as the final lesson duration after video editing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Only your homework and coding exercises including the EXAMtask might take approximately 20 hours to implement.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Go and try it yourself!We will appreciate your feedback.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   - Relevant knowledge
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!
 </p>
 <p>
  The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IToutsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 18 thousand people across all over the world (BTWmost of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha.
 </p>
 <p>
  With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best ITconsultants in the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   - Sequence of lessons
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  After the years of teaching offline, and based on the feedback of students who are passing online courses we realized how important the sequence of lessons is while teaching Java. The same issue is with the books where information is completely unstructured what makes things even more complex. For example, how students can learn object-oriented programming from the first lesson if they don't know yet the java syntax basics?Or how a student can implement a home task if he/she doesn't aware of java methods specifics, or doesn't know yet how to read program input?
 </p>
 <p>
  So in this course, you can be sure, that you will not get a home task to implement without having enough information to implement it. The program which is in this course is proven by many students who completed it offline and now work as software engineers in outsourcing companies and as freelancers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   - Interview practice tests
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  Being an IT consultant in different companies, the tutor of this course was in charge of driving the interview process in companies to make sure, that company selects the best people. That's why the first interview is always test. In case the test is completed, the candidate is invited to have a conversation. That's why in this course we want to prepare you to complete tests successfully!
 </p>
 <p>
  Especially for our students, we prepared tests that could be used to evaluate their knowledge during the interview process.
 </p>
 <p>
  2 tests. 90 questions each
  <strong>
   (180 interview tests in total).
  </strong>
  120 minutes each.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can read explanations for answers! That also can help you to learn the material better. Don't wait, try it now!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   - Q&amp;A support
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The significant difference between the online and offline learning processes is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concepts or to help fix your code on your computer.
  <br/>
  In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   <em>
    So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?:)), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course.
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   - Open source code
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  We hide nothing from our students!Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   - Free mobile App without limits for our students
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREEmobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms)
 </p>
 <p>
  The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview.
 </p>
 <p>
  Also,
  <strong>
   <em>
    only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification.
   </em>
  </strong>
  In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   - Coding exercises
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  To learn to program is not enough just watching videos and reading books. You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will have different practical tasks which will help you learn and understand Java better.
 </p>
 <p>
  One of the key tasks where you can practice your knowledge is the implementation of a backend system for an online store. Also, you have a lot of tasks that use domain-specific terminology:accounts, transactions, users, carts, menu, services, etc. So that means you are learning programming without abstract concepts like it is written in the books or in other courses. You learn domain-specific terminology and during the lessons, we investigate specific extracts from code that can give you a clear vision of how you can apply the knowledge in real life.
 </p>

   Planlı - Programlı Öğretim ve Sistematik Yaklaşım
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Neyi, ne zaman öğrenmeliyim, nasıl ilerlemeliyim derdine son! Uzmanı tarafından hazırlanmış ve yıllarca denenmiş; planlı ve programlı bir eğitim seti. Bu set içerisinde
  <strong>
   <em>
    asla gelişigüzel ve karışık anlatılmış konular bulamazsınız.
   </em>
  </strong>
  Bütün eğitimler belli seviyelere göre verilmiştir; bölümler kendi arasında ve dersler kendi içinde sistematiktir. (seviyeye uygun-sıralı- birbirini destekler ve geliştirir nitelikte)
 </p>
 <p>
  Not: Sistematik öğretim; birçok eğitim seti tarafından göz ardı edilen bir durumdur, çünkü karışık anlatmak çok kolaydır! Ancak karışık veya öğrencinin neyi nerede öğreneceğini seçmesi gereken setlerle başarıya ulaşmanız çok zordur. Çünkü bu planı yapabilecek bir öğrencinin eğitim setlerine zaten ihtiyacı yoktur!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   (Güncelleme) Sınav Sistemi:
  </strong>
  Her bölümde yer alan sınavlarla kendinizi sürekli olarak test edebilecek ve verdiğiniz cevaplara göre sınav sonucunda ''Öğrendiklerinizi ve eksik olduğunuz konuları'' rapor olarak alabileceksiniz.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Not:
  </strong>
  İsterseniz sınav sistemini
  <strong>
   ''Seviye Tespit Sınavı''
  </strong>
  olarak da kullanabilir ve sizin için en doğru seviyeden kursa başlayabilirsiniz. (sıfırdan başlamak istemiyorsanız.)
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Bütünsel Yaklaşım:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Gramer anlatmak bir İngilizce Öğretmeni için dünyanın en kolay şeyidir! Benzor olanı tercih ettimve üst düzey gramer eğitimlerinin yanı sıra
  <em>
   eşit derecede öneme sahip
  </em>
  <strong>

 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Ödev ve Görev Sistemi

  <strong>
   C++
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Which programming language can you learn that when added to your resume, will often get you a job interview?
  <strong>
   C++
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Which programming language is routinely ranked in the top 5 programming languages by popularity, and been consistently in the top 10 for close to 20 years?
  <strong>
   C++
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why you should learn C++
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Much, if not most of the software written today is still written in C++ and this has been the case for many, many years.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only is C++ popular, but itis also a very relevant language. If you go to GitHub you will see that there are a huge number of active C++ repositories and C++ is also extremely active on stack overflow.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are many, many leading software titles written entirely or partly in C++.These include the Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX operating systems!
 </p>
 <p>
  Many of the Adobe products such as Photoshop and Illustrator, the MySQL and MongoDB database engines, and many many more are written in C++.
 </p>
 <p>
  Leading tech companies use C++ for many of their products and internal research and development. These include Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, PayPal, Google, Facebook, Oracle, and many more.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Can you see how learning C++ will open up more career opportunities for you?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  If more professional companies are using C++, it stands to reason that there is going to be more of a demand for C++ programmers.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the main reason programmers should probably learn C++ is because it is so powerful!
 </p>
 <p>
  What do I mean by powerful?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   C++ issuper fast andis a general-purpose programming language that supports both procedure and object-oriented programming making it very flexible.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  It can scale easily. And it can be portable as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  C++ can do many things that other languages just can't.
 </p>
 <p>
  That's why nearly every major language has a way to interface with code written in C++.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since C++ has influenced so many languages, if you know C++ you'll likely see elements from C++ in new languages you learn.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   How can a beginner learn C++?
  </strong>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Finda good course, taught by an instructor with many years of experience in C++ is critical, as is the need for the instructor to have the necessary skills to be able to teach you the language.
 </p>
 <p>
  Frank Mitropolous, the instructor in this course has been using C++ for over 2 decades and has taught students in both university courses and industry training courses. He even worked on a C++ compiler development project while he was in the industry.
 </p>
 <p>
  So notonly will you be learning C++ from an expert C++ programmer, but you'll also be taught by an instructor who has successfully taughtat university level for many years.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a result, you can take this course with confidence, knowing that you will learn C++ the right way, and in the shortest possible timeframe.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Which version of C++ should I learn?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  C++ has had many version releases and updates over the years. It's a sad fact that most C++ courses do not teach Modern C++, but focus on old, obsolete versions of C++.
 </p>
 <p>
  Frank teaches you Modern C++ (specifically C++ 14 and C++17).
 </p>
 <p>
  Learn C++ the right way, with Modern C++, as taught by Frank in this course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What about C++20? Don't I need to learn about that as well?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  This course currently covers C++14 and C++17 but is still valid if you ultimately want to learn C++20.
 </p>
 <p>
  C++20 is new and the reality is that C++20 compilers and tools are not yet ready for prime time and the industry is using mainly C++14. So it's not really of any benefit for you to learn C++20 right now when the industry is not using it.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's going to take many, many years for the industry to migrate to C++20 and that means jobs for C++20 are not going to be around for quite some time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  What is available right now, are tons of jobs for Modern C++ developers, and you will obtain those skills in this course.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It's our sincere advice to focus on learning Modern C++ and not get too hung up on the latest and greatest versions of C++.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And even if you really do want to learn C++20, the new features in C++20 are mostly advanced features that require understanding the foundations of Modern C++.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you don't learn the basics, you won't master any version of C++.
 </p>
 <p>
  Learning the foundations of Modern C++ should be your priority, which you will learn in this course!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Is C++ difficult to learn?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  With all the power and flexibility of C++ comes complexity.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is no question that C++ is one of the most complex programming languages out there.
 </p>
 <p>
  But with the right instructor and the right training, you really canget up to speed with C++ quickly,and that's what this course is all about.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What will I learn in this course?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The course assumes no previous experience with C++ (or even programming in general), and you will end up with the skills to create your own programs in C++.
 </p>
 <p>
  Key topics covered include.
 </p>
 <p>
  * Looping with while, do/while for, range-based for statements and recursion
  <br/>
  * Performing calculations and displaying results
  <br/>
  * Functions
  <br/>
  * Pointers
  <br/>
  * Using existing classes and creating objects
  <br/>
  * Creating your own classes
  <br/>
  * Using Basic Standard Template Library classes such as Vector
  <br/>
  * Constructors and Destructors
  <br/>
  * Copy and Move semantics including Copy constructors, Move constructors, and copy and move assignment
  <br/>
  * How to overload operators
  <br/>
  * Using inheritance and class hierarchies
  <br/>
  * Using Polymorphic functions and dynamic binding
  <br/>
  * Using smart pointers
  <br/>
  * Using stream I/O
  <br/>
  * An introduction to the C++ STL
  <br/>
  * An introduction to Exception Handling
  <br/>
  * And much more.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   How is this C++ course different from other courses?
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  You will learn Modern C++, for one.
  <strong>
   Many, perhaps most other courses on Udemy teach you old, obsolete versions of C++.
  </strong>
  If you are going to learn C++, it's imperative that you learn the Modern version to maximize your career opportunities and to ensure your skills are up to date.
 </p>
 <p>
  The course format includes theory and concepts which are then reinforced with live code examples. Often the C++ debugger is used to step through code and analyze variables to better understand the behavior of C++. The instructor also uses a pen tablet to write on the screen and provide even more visual explanations.
 </p>
 <p>
  You won't find better C++ training anywhere, and you will struggle to find someone with as much industry and training experience asyour instructor Frank has.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What do I get out of learning C++?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  More career options for one! C++ is one of the most popular programming languages used in games development.  It's also heavily used in embedded applications. Your investment in time in learning C++ will reward you time and time again with more pay, and more opportunities, and frankly, more fun!
 </p>

  QUITE POSSIBLY THE FASTEST WAY TO LEARN HOW TO BUILD PROFESSIONAL QUALITY WEBSITES FOR BEGINNERS, NON-PROGRAMMERS AND ENTREPRENEURS
 </p>
 <p>
  So you want to learn how to build websites but you're not quite sure how.
 </p>
 <p>
  Welllllll, you could do like me and spend months learning every knook and cranny of HTML and CSS before you even put up your first webpage. This could lead to frustration, feelings of being overwhelmed and highly increases the chances that you'll give up without a site to show for it.
 </p>
 <p>
  OR….. YOU COULD START LEARNING BY DOING AND HAVE YOUR FIRST WEBSITE UP THIS WEEK.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you want to learn something fast you need to jump in and start getting your hands dirty from the beginning. Have you ever noticed that you don't really learn something until you actually try to do it, and experience it firsthand? Well that's exactly what we'll do in this course. You'll learn by building your first website this week.
 </p>
 <p>
  And don't worry if HTML and CSS or websites in general intimidate you. Learning to build websites is actually a lot easier than you think...if you are taught correctly. And I'll be here with you the whole time. I personally respond to and answer all questions you and other students have.

  One question or concern I get a lot is that people want to learn deep learning and data science, so they take these courses, but they get left behind because they don’t know enough about the Numpy stack in order to turn those concepts into code.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if I write the code in full, if you don’t know Numpy, then it’s still very hard to read.
 </p>
 <p>
  This course is designed to remove that obstacle - to show you how to do things in the Numpy stack that are frequently needed in deep learning and data science.
 </p>
 <p>
  So what are those things?
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Numpy
  </strong>
  . This forms the basis for everything else. The central object in Numpy is the Numpy array, on which you can do various operations.
 </p>
 <p>
  The key is that a Numpy array isn’t just a regular array you’d see in a language like Java or C++, but instead is like a mathematical object like a vector or a matrix.
 </p>
 <p>
  That means you can do vector and matrix operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
 </p>
 <p>
  The most important aspect of Numpy arrays is that they are optimized for speed. So we’re going to do a demo where I prove to you that using a Numpy vectorized operation is faster than using a Python list.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then we’ll look at some more complicated matrix operations, like products, inverses, determinants, and solving linear systems.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Pandas.
  </strong>
  Pandas is great because it does a lot of things under the hood, which makes your life easier because you then don’t need to code those things manually.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pandas makes working with datasets a lot like R, if you’re familiar with R.
 </p>
 <p>
  The central object in R and Pandas is the DataFrame.
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ll look at how much easier it is to load a dataset using Pandas vs. trying to do it manually.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then we’ll look at some dataframe operations useful in machine learning, like filtering by column, filtering by row, and the apply function.
 </p>
 <p>
  Pandas dataframes will remind you of SQLtables, so if you have an SQL background and you like working with tables then Pandas will be a great next thing to learn about.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since Pandas teaches us how to load data, the next step will be looking at the data. For that we will use
  <strong>
   Matplotlib
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  In this section we’ll go over some common plots, namely the line chart, scatter plot, and histogram.
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ll also look at how to show images using Matplotlib.
 </p>
 <p>
  99% of the time, you’ll be using some form of the above plots.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Scipy
  </strong>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  I like to think of Scipy as an addon library to Numpy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whereas Numpy provides basic building blocks, like vectors, matrices, and operations on them, Scipy uses those general building blocks to do specific things.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, Scipy can do many common statistics calculations, including getting the PDF value, the CDF value, sampling from a distribution, and statistical testing.
 </p>
 <p>
  It has signal processing tools so it can do things like convolution and the Fourier transform.
 </p>
 <p>
  In sum:
 </p>
 <p>
  If you’ve taken a deep learning or machine learning course, and you understand the theory, and you can see the code, but you can’t make the connection between how to turn those algorithms into actual running code, this course is for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  ""If you can't implement it, you don't understand it""
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Or as the great physicist Richard Feynman said: ""What I cannot create, I do not understand"".
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    My courses are the ONLY courses where you will learn how to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Other courses will teach you how to plug in your data into a library, but do you really need help with 3 lines of code?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    After doing the same thing with 10 datasets, you realize you didn't learn 10 things. You learned 1 thing, and just repeated the same 3 lines of code 10 times...
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  Suggested Prerequisites:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    matrix arithmetic
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    probability
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Python coding: if/else, loops, lists, dicts, sets
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    you should already know ""why"" things like a dot product, matrix inversion, and Gaussian probability distributions are useful and what they can be used for
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>

   What is this course about?
   <br/>
   The Complete React JS Course - Basics to Advanced
  </strong>
  this course is a complete guide for
  <strong>
   React JS
  </strong>
  . Here, you will learn all the concepts required for becoming a
  <strong>
   front-end React JS developer
  </strong>
  . If you are new to web development or a professional developer who's creating websites with plain old javascript or jQuery, this is your time to learn React JS and take your web development skills to the next level and impress your recruiter or clients.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   React JS
  </strong>
  is gaining rapid popularity. In a very short time, it has become the most widely accepted web development JavaScript library. This is the right time for you to learn and add React JS to your skillset and excel in your career.
 </p>
 <p>
  This course is designed in a way that anyone can understand the journey from the
  <strong>
   basics to advanced concepts of React
  </strong>
  with simple explanations by the instructor along with
  <strong>
   hands-on assignments and projects.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   In the first part of this course:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    We cover what is React JS, how it uses JSX, how the compilation is done behind the scenes using babel to browser understandable plain old HTML, CSS, and javascript.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    After that, we explain 'components' which are the basic building blocks of a web page while working with React JS. We also cover the stateless and stateful components and when to use those components as well.
   </p>
   <p>
    <br/>
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  In the
  <strong>
   next section
  </strong>
  , we learn
  <strong>
   how to create modules in React JS
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   how to import or export those modules to other files
  </strong>
  so that we can reuse the same set of code.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   In the following section
  </strong>
  , we will work on
  <strong>
   how do we style the components using CSS modules
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   how to create a nice user-friendly mobile responsive website.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  We also cover
  <strong>
   how to work with props
  </strong>
  ,
  <strong>
   how to pass data from stateful to stateless components
  </strong>
  , and
  <strong>
   how to pass functions from one component to another component.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  We
  <strong>
   explain the different lifecycle methods
  </strong>
  of a React Component and
  <strong>
   how we can access
  </strong>
  and modify the data between these lifecycles using the various lifecycle methods available to us.
 </p>
 <p>
  We will keep on
  <strong>
   adding more videos
  </strong>
  to the course as we are creating them. These videos will be available to you soon.

  HTML is short for 'HyperText Markup Language', which means HTML is only used to create a structure of the web page. But without some styling, no assignment or project will look good. Thus, we will cover some portion of the CSS required to create simple web pages.
 </p>
 <p>
  This HTML course will be beneficial for all who are looking to start their career in the web development field and aspire to become a Frontend or Full-stack web developer. This HTML course will be the first step towards your goal to become a web developer. To continue this journey, we would recommend you complete the other languages and skills like CSS, JavaScript, ES6, React.

  ""As a young reporter my prose might have been robotic and jargon-laden if not for Shani's watchful eye and attention to the elusive human interest behind ostensibly technical stories. Beyond the standard (yet crucial) reporting skills—like accuracy, clarity and integrity—I also learned refinement, how to withstand impulses toward glibness and cynicism that can naturally set in when oft revisiting the same beat. Shani will teach you how to write well, and with grace.""

  <strong>
   Why ReactJs?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  You know Companies Worldwide
  <strong>
   Require React JS Developers.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  React.js is one of the most demanding frameworks in the market;31.3% of worldwide specialists are currently utilizing ReactJs. Some of the world’s top tech teams use the tool to design scalable, easy-to-maintain solutions — Netflix, PayPal, eBay, Airbnb, and more. Why are businesses so interested in React.js implementation? Here are the benefits of adopting the framework:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Increased app development speed.
    </strong>
    The framework accepts HTML code input and has excellent subcomponent rendering support. Development teams can benefit from JSX as well — it’s an extension with a range of shortcuts that cuts the amount of code writing time.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Improved code stability
    </strong>
    . React.js reduces the impact of change in the code file since the changes in parent components don’t affect the children. Such a data binding approach facilitates software testing and helps ensure stable app performance after update deployments.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     SEO-friendliness.
    </strong>
    React.js deals with the inability of search engine crawlers to process JS-heavy pages. Even a beginner with an entry-level react developer salary can deploy React on a server and use the virtual DOM to view the code as a regular web page in a browser.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Robust toolkit.
    </strong>
    React.js has a wide range of debugging and interface design tools.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Strong user community and an affordable remote react developer salary.
    </strong>
    Since a large number of teams are deploying the framework, the tool is regularly updated. There’s no shortage of user-generated content either — you can find dozens of helpful React tutorials and case studies to make the most out of the framework.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Asking for a Senior react developer salary. It’s one of the most in-demand frameworks at the moment — that’s why business owners are willing to find professionals with a moderate mid-level react developer salary within and beyond their home regions.

 Learn all the basics of online entrepreneurship while building a real business with your own portfolio of websites.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <b>
  What you'll learn:
 </b>
 <br/>
 <ul>
  <li>
   To build a $5,000 / month passive income website portfolio.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <br/>
 <p>
  HOW TO MAKE MONEY ONLINE: Learn how to make money from home with my step-by-step plan to build a $5,000 per month passive income website portfolio (based on building 10 websites that make at least $500 per month each).
 </p>
 <p>
  In association with the Make Money from Home LIONS CLUB.
 </p>
 <p>
  NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE REQUIRED. ALL INSTRUCTIONS ARE FULLY DETAILED AND STEP-BY-STEP SO ANYONE CAN FOLLOW THEM EASILY.
 </p>
 <p>
  Online passive income is the ultimate dream. Making money while you sleep. Everybody wants it.
 </p>
 <p>
  But is it really possible?
 </p>
 <p>
  The short answer is ""yes.""
 </p>
 <p>
  The longer answer is ""yes, but it isn't easy to accomplish.""
 </p>
 <p>
  If it was, wouldn't everyone be doing it?
 </p>
 <p>
  In my course, I give you a step-by-step plan on how to develop a passive income website portfolio and show you how making money online actually works.
 </p>
 <p>
  The specific plan I teach is designed to make you $5,000 per month in passive income earnings, based on 10 websites, with each website having a targeted earnings level of at least $500 each. Once you understand the process though, you can decide to build 20 of these websites, or 100! When you stop is up to you (and yes, there are people making tens of thousands of dollars per month on the Internet based on these concepts - they just love the work and don't ever stop building new websites or expanding their current ones!).
 </p>
 <p>
  What's great about the business plan that I teach you is not only the income level you will accomplish if you follow through, but all that you will learn in the process. The first lesson you are taught is how to build a website or blog using WordPress on your own domain (without having to learn how to code). The skills you learn in this course will enable you to build all kinds of online businesses and open the door for all kinds of entrepreneurial projects you may have.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Note
  </strong>
  : When I say we will be creating a website using WordPress, I don't mean creating one through the WordPress website. Websites created through the WordPress website are severely limited in what you can do with them and offer very little flexibility overall. The method I teach enables you to create truly professional websites by installing the WordPress software and you won't be limited in any way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not only that, you will be able to evaluate business ideas much more intelligently once you've gone through this whole process. You will understand the fundamentals of keyword research &amp; analysis, traffic &amp; lead generation, social &amp; affiliate marketing, monetization &amp; conversion testing, and traffic analysis. These skills will help you immensely in ANY business you ever decide to start (online or not, passive or not).
 </p>
 <p>
  Generating an online passive income won't happen overnight and takes a lot of hard work, but going through the process is completely worth it and having an exact plan of action is the ONLY way to ensure success.
 </p>
 <p>
  Let me put it this way: if you were offered no pay for six months for 40+ hours of work per week, but after those six months, you got $5,000+ per month for the rest of your life, would that be worth it to you?
 </p>
 <p>
  If that idea isn't unbelievably exciting to you, then this isn't the business for you.
 </p>
 <p>
  This isn't a get rich quick scheme. This is a business. Except with this business, instead of trading your time for money (like most jobs), you are investing your time. You work hard now and continue to reap the benefits indefinitely. Building an online business takes a lot of work and a lot of patience, but the rewards can be amazing.
 </p>
 <p>
  That's the kind of business I teach you in this course.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   NOTE
  </strong>
  : Throughout my course you will be referred to video lessons. While everything in video lessons are as up to date as possible (I frequently update the video lessons), the place to check for the most up-to-date information is in the
  <em>
   video descriptions
  </em>
  (on the same page you watch the videos). This can be the video descriptions on the pages of the LIONS CLUB website, or the video description of the Udemy or YouTube pages. Be sure to read the video descriptions of each video
  <em>
   before
  </em>
  watching the video itself.

  </strong>
  which can oscillate between $86K - $163K per year depending on the years of experience and level of expertise.

   What are the advantages of Agile Project Management?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    In Agile Project Management you deliver projects faster.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Agile Project Managementfosters an environment of constant collaboration, teamwork and focus on execution.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    In Agile Project Management you have direct input from your customer throughout the whole project.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    In Agile Project Management udemy you constantly reflect for improvement with sessions called Retrospectives.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Agile Project Management shifts from traditional long documentation processes and long meetings to agile, lean processes, practices and rituals such as the daily standup.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    In Agile Project Management roles blur, meaning everyone can participate on different tasks regardless of whether it's their ""official"" role or not. For example, not only testers test, but others too (if the teams decides that).
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Agile Project Management udemy, allows you to focus on value and the minimum required working solution known as the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). So you apply a basic/yet really important concept all the time: keep it simple!!! Don't build a Ferrari if all you need is a skateboard!
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Visual boards (Kanbans) and reports (burn down charts), are a key part of Agile Project Management udemy. It allows everyone to stay on the same page and be able to understand speed of execution, areas of improvement and more.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    And there are many more advantages, but you'll learn more about that as you go through the course :)

   <em>
    Dear Students,
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Hi, Tomas Moravek here, Internet Efficiency 2016 Award Winning Digital Strategist, to introduce my brand new, updated, SEO &amp; Copywriting MASTERY Course.
 </p>
 <p>
  I've put so much passion, energy, and time in to creating this SEO Training for you and I can't wait until you join my thousands of satisfied students so you can see for yourself why my strategies really work.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Organic and Paid Search Results
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Google has two different categories of search results that it displays – paid and organic. There is a BIG difference in the way these two types of results are ranked. With organic search results, there are many more ranking factors that you will need to consider if you want to perform well in search. When it comes to paid results, advertisers are ranked according to the amount they’ll pay a single visitor, sent to them through Google’s Pay Per Click Ad’s network. The more they are willing to pay the higher they will rank. It’s as simple as that.
 </p>
 <p>
  Organic search doesn’t work in the same way. You can’t pay your way to the top. Instead, you need to optimise your site, pages, and content so you score highly in Google’s ranking algorithm. The good news is, when people search for information on a topic, most people trust organic search results FAR more than they trust paid results.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this video, we’ll be focusing solely on organic results, and giving you tips and advice you can use to perform well in organic Google search.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why do you need SEO?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Search engines will be one of the main sources of traffic to your webpage and Google is the biggest and most popular search engine, by far. Google searches create over half of ALL the traffic on the entire internet, so you can see why it makes sense to optimise your site for Google’s algorithm.
 </p>
 <p>
  When it’s applied correctly, SEO can help your website rank for 100’s of related keywords in your niche, generating 1000’s of visitors on each of those phrases every month.
 </p>
 <p>
  People using paid results would pay a premium for this amount of traffic but by applying some smart SEO principles, you can get it all - for free. Let’s look at some of the things you can do to score highly with Google, so you can start getting a consistent stream of traffic to your website.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Learn Modern White Hat SEO Strategies...
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  White Hat SEO tactics are the most effective as they comply with the major search engine’s terms and conditions and have been fully approved by them. Not only that, they focus on a human audience as opposed to search engines, so are far more effective at organically growing your reach than Black Hat or Grey Hat techniques.

   <em>
    You're here because you want to create your own WordPress websites, right?
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   This WordPress for Beginners course is the perfect place to start.
  </strong>
  This complete WordPress course is designed for beginners like you who have never built a WordPress website (or any website for that matter).
 </p>
 <p>
  WordPress is the perfect tool for creating a fully customized website for any purpose. Whether you want to create a blog, a personal portfolio, ora business website to sell your products and services,you can do it with WordPress.
 </p>
 <p>
  While WordPress might seem scary from the outside, once you get started, it's fairly intuitive.
  <strong>
   Everything from hosting to installing a theme, then actually building your first pages can be learned in the first few lessons of this course.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  With this WordPress course, you don't need to actually pay for hosting to practice with WordPress. I'll show you how to create a free temporary site so you can follow along.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why learn WordPress from me?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  I've been building WordPress websites for years. Just like you, there was a time when I was a complete newbie! I was honestly scared of starting a WordPress website because it seemed so daunting.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Now I love WordPress!
  </strong>
  I wouldn't recommend using any other web-building tool.
 </p>
 <p>
  I still remember what it is like to be a beginner, and I've kept that in mind while creating this entire course. I walk you through every process step-by-step to make sure you understand things clearly. And if there is ever anything that is confusing, just let me know and I'll create more lessons that explain or walk you through myself.

  <strong>
   Is this course for you?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Now that you know what this course is about, let's see if this course is for you!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Here are three types of students who will love this course:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Student #1:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Has some JavaScript experience and is interested in what this language can do. You heard and read that JavaScript allows you to create nice web applications and enhance existing web pages. VueJS is your choice!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Student #2:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  You already have some experience with other frontend frameworks like Angular (2+) or ReactJS. But either due to interest or disappointment of the existing frameworks, you seek some alternatives - VueJS might be what you were looking for!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Student #3:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Has experience with backend frameworks/ languages but now also wants to enter the frontend world. VueJS is an awesome choice here, it's fun, it uses native JS and it's extremely powerful!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Bonus: Student #4
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Is disappointed by Angular 2+. Does a good framework need 2 hours of setup? No, certainly not - as VueJS will prove to this student!
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Let's dive into VueJS right now!

  This introductory course to Photoshop covers the fundamental functions to get started editing and improving photos. The student learns how to customize workspaces and panels, navigate the canvas effectively, work with multiple images and file types, and use various methods of image enhancement, including layering, selecting, and masking. Support files are included for this course, so students can follow along in the hands-on lectures. If you're a beginner to Photoshop or simply want to learn more about various selections, layering, and masking techniques, this course is for you!
 </p>
 <p>
  The course is structured in a way to maximize learning. I first go over how to do basic functions in Photoshop like
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Adjusting settings of new documents
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>

  <strong>
   COURSEOVERVIEW:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Developing
  <strong>
   RESTful web services and RESTAPI
  </strong>
  is fun. The combination of Java, Spring Boot, Spring Web MVC, Spring Web Services and JPA makes it even more fun. And its even more fun to create Microservices.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are
  <strong>
   two parts
  </strong>
  to this course - RESTful web services and Microservices
 </p>
 <p>
  Architectures are moving towards microservices.RESTful web services are the
  <strong>
   first step
  </strong>
  to developing great microservices. Java and Spring Boot, in combination with Spring Web MVC (also called Spring REST) makes it easy to develop RESTful web services.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   In the first part of the course
  </strong>
  , you will
  <strong>
   learn the basics of RESTful web services
  </strong>
  developing resources for a social media application. You will learn to implement these resources with multiple features -
  <strong>
   versioning
  </strong>
  , exception handling,
  <strong>
   documentation
  </strong>
  (Swagger), basic authentication (Spring Security),
  <strong>
   filtering
  </strong>
  and HATEOAS. You will learn the
  <strong>
   best practices

  This guy is fantastic. Really. Wonderful teaching skills, and goes well out of his way to make sure that everything he is doing is fully understood. This is the kind of tutorial that gets me excited to work with a framework that I may otherwise not be.

  The best part of it is the hands-on approach which the author maintained throughout the course as he had promised at the beginning of the lecture. He explains the concepts really well and also makes sure that there is not a single line of code you type without understanding what it really does.

  I also appreciate the mind and hands approach of teaching something and then having the student apply it. It makes everything a lot clearer for the student and uncovers issues that we will face in our project early.

  Amazing course. Explained super difficult concepts (that I have spent hours on the internet finding a good explanation) in under 5 minutes.

 <p>
  <strong>
   One of Udemy's Top Selling Courses of All Time - New &amp; Improved Version 2.5!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Don't accept imitations!
 </p>
 <p>
  After over 50,000 satisfied students in our original course, Become a SuperLearner® has been updated, upgraded, and improved from the ground up.
 </p>
 <p>
  This course will teach you how to hack your learning, reading, and memory skills, empowering you to learn anything and everything faster and more effectively.
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether you're a student, a professional, or simply embarking on a new hobby, you are forced to grapple with an ever-increasing amount of information and knowledge. In fact, it's believed that one week's worth of the New York Times contains more information than people 100 years ago encountered in their entire lives. We've all experienced the frustration of an ever-growing reading list, struggling to learn a new language, or forgetting things you learned in even your favorite subjects.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Anyone can develop SuperLearning skills!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  This course is about improving your ability to learn new skills or information
  <em>
   quickly and effectively
  </em>
  . We go far beyond the kinds of ""speed-reading"" (or glorified skimming) you may have been exposed to, diving into the
  <em>
   actual cognitive and neurological factors
  </em>
  that make learning easier and more successful. We also give you advanced memory techniques to grapple with the huge loads of information you'll be able to process.
 </p>
 <p>
  You'll learn how to input and retain information in a whole new way - a faster, better way
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   The core of this SuperLearning course involves 3 ""Super Skills"":
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Speed-reading with high (80%+) comprehension and understanding
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Memory techniques for storing and recalling vast amounts of information quickly and accurately
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Developing the cognitive infrastructure to support this flood of new information long-term
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  However, the SuperLearning skills you'll learn in this course are applicable to many aspects of your every day life, from remembering phone numbers to acquiring new skills or even speaking new languages.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   How this new course will change your life and triple your learning speed:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  The sad irony is that in order to learn most of these superlearning skills and memory techniques in the past, you had to read dozens of books and psychological journals. Or, you had to hire an expensive private tutor who specializes in superlearning. That's what I did. And it changed my life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fortunately, my instructors (experts in the fields of superlearning, memory techniques, and speed-reading) agreed to help me transform their materials into the first ever digital course. That course,
  <em>
   Become a SuperLearner™ 1.0,
  </em>
  took the internet by storm, becoming one of the top courses in the history of Udemy, and resulting in a bestselling book and top-ranking podcast.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   How is it different from SuperLearner® 1.0?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Over the last 2 years and 50,000+ students, we’ve had tens of thousands of data points and pieces of feedback, helping us improve both our methodology and our teaching practices. This new course has more (and better) content than ever before, including:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Completely re-written lectures emphasizing clarity and engagement!
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    All-new lectures on topics never before covered!
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Hands-on demonstration videos for every major concept
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Dramatically improved video and audio quality
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Interactive worksheets to print and complete
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Even MORE supplemental resources!
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  We can confidently say that this is the best, most comprehensive accelerated learning product we’ve ever released on Udemy.
 </p>
 <p>
  The course will require 2-3 hours of memory and speed-reading practice and training per week, and last roughly 7-9 weeks. It won't be easy - but if you put in the work, you are guaranteed to succeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  In addition to the lectures, there is an additional 1.5 hours of supplemental video content from TED, YouTube, and other sources which are considered part of the course curriculum.

 <p>
  Nesse módulo gratuito do curso React Ninja, você aprenderá a configurar o webpack para facilitar o desenvolvimento de aplicações web utilizando React.js.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Veremos desde o básico do webpack, passando pelo webpack dev server, onde iremos configurar um servidor para servir nossos arquivos, e configuraremos o hot reload, para agilizar a atualização das informações no browser.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Observação importante:
  </strong>
  esse módulo é apenas umaparte do curso React.js Ninja. Aqui nós estamos usando o webpack na versão 1. No curso completo nós vemos como funciona a migração para as próximas versões, e inclusive configurações mais avançadas.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mas para conseguir acompanhar até o final semerros, instale as versões corretas das dependências. Você vai encontrar a lista de todas elas no repositório do curso, no GitHub -eu mostro o link nos vídeos ;)

 <ul>
  <li>
   UI using Photoshop
  </li>
 </ul>
 <br/>
 <p>
  Photoshop is one of the best tools, so learn it with this Photoshop Web Design Tutorial!
 </p>
 <p>
  I have been using Photoshop since version 3 and every time it gets better and better. I have created litterally thousands of designs and over that time I have found that there are number of key skills and tools us web designers use in almost every design. This is why I created, along with the team at Web Courses, a series of screencast tutorials ideal for beginner web designers who wants to Learn Web Design with Photoshop.
 </p>
 1. The Power of File and New
 <br/>
 <p>
  In this lesson, you will learn how to open a new document and apply the settings you need to set up before you start designing in Photoshop.
 </p>
 <br/>
 2. Changing, Using and Installing Brushes
 <br/>
 <p>
  A look at paintbrushes. The different types of brushes that you can use as well as installing some new brushes, so you can do some really nice affects on your design.
 </p>
 <br/>
 3. The Key to Custom Shapes
 <br/>
 <p>
  Shapes is something we use a lot when we're designing a web page. It's used to make the layout and lots of other elements on the screen. We get used to this really useful tool in this lesson.
 </p>
 <br/>
 4. The Core of Photoshop, Layers and Groups
 <br/>
 <p>
  Layers are the most important part of Photoshop, as they allow you to make changes to specific areas on the screen. You can further group these layers together to make it more manageable when you're designing.
 </p>
 <br/>
 5. The Shortcuts to Moving and Resizing
 <br/>
 <p>
  In this lesson we're going to be looking at how to move layers around the screen and how to resize them using the free transform tool, something you will use a lot in your designs.
 </p>
 <br/>
 6. Getting the Most from Zooming and Panning
 <br/>
 <p>
  We are going to look at how to look around your design and see the details by using the zoom tool. So in this lesson we look into two very important features of using Photoshop daily, zooming and panning.
 </p>
 <br/>
 7. Creating Cool Effects with Blending Modes
 <br/>
 <p>
  Blending modes are when you have two layers interacting with each other and effects are different things you can apply to single layer, things like shadows, inners shadows, gradients etc.
 </p>
 <br/>
 8. Text, Love it or Hate it
 <br/>
 <p>
  Texts are one of the trickiest things in Photoshop, reason being that its not really made to do it. So in this lesson, we're going to find easy ways to work with Photoshop and texts.
 </p>
 <br/>
 9. Clean Web Page Design using Photoshop
 <br/>
 <p>
  We are going to be creating a webpage design in Photoshop. We are going to use grids to organize everything and get things in line and various other tricks to make the perfect web page.

   What makes me qualified to teach you?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  I'm a self-taught video editor and full time vlogger that started off like you!
 </p>
 <p>
  In 2016, I had zero video editing experience, no laptop, no students and no YouTube channel. Fast forward to April 2021, I have;
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    650+ videos on my vlogging YouTube channel
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Almost 12,000 YouTube subscribers with over 7.44 million minutes watched
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    275,000+ students in my online video courses
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Over 5,000 reviews
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Trust me, as I review my stats it sounds crazy to me too! I never expected in a million years to be in my current position with these achievements. I started with nothing. If I can do it, I am confident that you can do it too.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What Makes This Course Different?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  My ambition with this course is to take 5 years of my video editing knowledge and experience, and put it in an easy-to-follow course so you can learn in 1 week what has taken the last 5 years to learn. This course is the most comprehensive beginner editing course where, by the end of the course, you'll feel confident editing your own amazing video projects.

   <p>

 </p>
 <p>
  Here are some more details of what you get with The Business Intelligence Analyst Course:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Introduction to Data and Data Science
    </strong>
    – Make sense of terms like business intelligence, traditional and big data, traditional statistical methods, machine learning, predictive analytics, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and many more;
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Statistics and Excel
    </strong>
    – Understand statistical testing and build a solid foundation. Modern software packages and programming languages are automating most of these activities, but this part of the course gives you something more valuable – critical thinking abilities;
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Database theory
    </strong>
    – Before you start using SQL, it is highly beneficial to learn about the underlying database theory and acquire an understanding of why databases are created and how they can help us manage data
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     SQL
    </strong>
    - when you can work with SQL, it means you don’t have to rely on others sending you data and executing queries for you. You can do that on your own. This allows you to be independent and dig deeper into the data to obtain the answers to questions that might improve the way your company does its business
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Tableau
    </strong>
    – one of the most powerful and intuitive data visualization tools available out there. Almost all large companies use such tools to enhance their BI capabilities. Tableau is the #1 best-in-class solution that helps you create powerful charts and dashboards
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Learning a programming language is meaningless without putting it to use. That’s why we integrate SQL and Tableau, and perform several real-life Business Intelligence tasks
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Sounds amazing, right?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Our courses are unique because our team works hard to:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Pre-script the entire content
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Work with real-life examples
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Provide easy to understand and complete explanations
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Create beautiful and engaging animations
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Prepare exercises, course notes, quizzes, and other materials that will enhance your course taking experience
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Be there for you and provide support whenever necessary
   </p>
  </li>

  tutorial you've been looking for to
  <strong>
   become a modern web developer in 2023.
  </strong>
  It doesn’t just cover a small portion of the industry. This covers everything you need to know to get hired: from absolute zero knowledge to being able to put things on your resume that will allow you to live the life you want.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sounds too good to be true? Give me 5 minutes of your time to explain why I built this WebDevelopment course and what is different here than thousands of other courses all over the internet:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     I update the course every month to make sure you learn the most up to date skills!
    </strong>
    There is no wasted time here. We won’t be using outdated technologies like PHP, Wordpress and JQuery. Although still useful, outdated technologies like the above are low paying and demands for them are decreasing. In this course, you will learn the specific technologies that are the most in demand in the industry right now. These include
    <strong>
     tools and technologies used by the biggest tech companies like Google, Facebook, Instagram, etc… It is geared specifically for people that want to learn employable skills in 2023.
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </strong>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    After finishing this course, you will be able to apply for developer roles, get a promotion, or upgrade your job title as a developer and earn a higher salary. We won't be taking any shortcuts in this course.
    <strong>
     You are going to gofrom absolute zero: where you learn how the internet works. To mastery: where you build an image recognition app using aMachine Learning API (a subset of Artificial Intelligence) and all the other modern technologies that we learn in the course.Most students have commented how the projects in this course have impressed their interviewers and allowed them to get an offer.
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </strong>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    This course is taught by an instructor who has worked in Silicon Valley, and one of the top tech companies in Toronto.
    <strong>
     I have built large scale applications, and have managed teams of developers. I am not an online marketer or a salesman, but a software developer who has worked directly with these technologies. I love programming and believe that there needs to be a course out there that actually teaches valuable real life skills (because most of them are taught by teachers with no work experience).
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </strong>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Your time is valuable and you don't want to spend thousands of dollars on a bootcamp. You want a course that outlines the best way to become a Web Developer, in simple and well explained terms, so that you fully understand topics instead of watching somebody on your screen and having no clue what is going on.
    <strong>
     I have taken the best pieces, tools, and practices that I have found over the years, and condensed everything into this course. 50 hours of videos doesn't mean much if the instructor isn't engaging or focuses on outdated topics.I made sure that everything covered in this course is efficient and focuses on getting you job ready as soon as possible!
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </strong>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Wehave a thriving online chat community so you really feel like you are part of a classroom and not just watching videos by yourself.
    </strong>
    You will have a chance to communicate with fellow students, work on group projects together, and contribute to open source projects. Anytime you have a question, you can ask in many locations and get help right away (including from myself).
   </p>
   <p>
    <br/>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    The course is designed to
    <strong>
     give you employable skills so you can get a job
    </strong>
    . Here is what one student recently wrote after taking the course and being hired right away:
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <em>
     ""I’m a self taught dev, who has been out of work for ~6 months. I had some family things that came up that prevented me from seeking permanent employment, so for awhile I was Postmates/Uber delivery driver.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     After taking this course, I immediately got catapulted back to where I was before, but better equipped and with the knowledge to take on the next job. I had just finished the React section when I went to a recent interview, and it really helped me excel. As of today, I am officially re-employed back in the field, and it is all thanks to this course.I had a blast creating the final project, and FINALLY got around to learning SQL statements, and getting to use them in a project. I’m really ecstatic that Andrei went with teaching relational databases over something like MongoDB, which can also be fun, but is less practical for use on the job. So thanks Andrei, I really enjoyed the course and will be making sure to share it with others who find it helpful. I’m also looking forward to the new ES10 content that was recently added, and going through the DB stuff again when I go to build a personal project."" - J.C.

  This course is the accumulation of all of my years working in the industry, learning, and teaching. There is so much information out there, so many opinions, and so many ways of doing things, that unless you have spent the last few years working with these technologies in a company, you will never fully understand. So this course is the answer to thatexactproblem for you: How to gain experience when you need experience to get hired? I have gone through thousands of coding books, online tutorials and bootcamps.
  <strong>
   Throughout the years I have taken notes on what has worked and what hasn't, and I have created this course to narrow down the most efficient way to learn with the most relevant information.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  I am 100% confident that you won't find a course like this out there. We're not going to be building simple todo applicationsand cat image sliders. We are going to learn actualpractical skills that will put you into the workforce. Some unique sections that you won't find anywhere else are:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     React.js + Redux:
    </strong>
    You will learn the library that companies like Netflix, Facebook and Instagram use to build fast, scalable applications.This is one of the highest in-demand skill in the industry.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     A day in the life of a developer:
    </strong>
    What will your day to day look like and what tools will youuse?I will take you through a sample day at a tech company.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     How does the internet actually work?What is the history of these technologies?:
    </strong>
    You will actually understand the underlying concepts of the internet, and how the technologies we have now, have come to be where they are.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     How do youactually deploy a real life app so that it is secure, and won't get hacked?:
    </strong>
    How does a real life app get out to the public in a safe and secure way?
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     What is Machine Learning and how you canharness its power:
    </strong>
    Whether you have heard about it or not, this is something that you will hear more and more in the coming years. Those who understand the high level concepts and can harness its power will have an advantage.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     What does your developer environment on your computer look like?:
    </strong>
    We will be setting up our computers with all the tools necessary of a developer so you can use the same setup when you go work in the industry.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Why do we teach the above? Because in this day and age,
  <strong>
   just knowing HTML CSSand Javascript is not good enough, and you won't be able to grow in your role and command a higher salary. You will learn these things because these are the things you should know in 2023 so that you are miles ahead of the rest.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  Make thisthe year that you took a risk, you learnedhighly in demand skills, you had new experiences, and you received new opportunities. I hope you join me in this journey.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   This is the proudest work I have ever done in my life and I am confident that you won't find a course better than this.

   Taught by:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  Andrei is the instructor of the
  <strong>
   highest rated Web Development course on Udemy as well as one of the fastest growing.
  </strong>
  His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp.
  <strong>
   Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.
  </strong>
  Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained.
  <strong>
   He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.

   What Other Students Are Saying About My CompTIA Security+ Course:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    I passed the Security+ exam. This course was absolutely essential to passing that exam. Only the Dion Security+ covered the topics comprehensively and thoroughly enough. No other resource I used came close. (Kolya, 5 stars)
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    I have just completed watching two different instructor corses on the same subject. I must say, Dion's has more information in a better constructed manner. This course is not easy, it is heavy with information and having you sit through shorter videos was the best part. Having watched more than just Dion's, I can say he goes over the content much better. Very glad I chose to watch a second course! (Rutger, 5 stars)
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    I love taking this wonderful course. It's full of important tips and amazing steps in order to pass CompTIA Security+. Thank you, Jason Dion, for making this incredible course! (Paul, 5 stars)

  Javascript is the language of the web. So if you want to become a web developer, Javascript is a must learn language. This is an in-depth course which teaches seemingly difficult concepts like functional programming in a easy to understand way. Along the course, we also compare Javascript with other languages like Java, so that people having some experience with a language like C, Java or C#, which are statically typed languages, can easily understand how to write good Javascript programs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Javascript has been notorious when it comes to finding bugs in the program. This course also talks about some pitfalls in the language which should be avoided, so that you have a much easier time writing code and debugging in this language.

  <em>
   ""Thank you for the great opportunity to follow your course. For the past years I have followed a number of courses on public speaking worldwide in order to update myself on skills in public speaking. As a speech language pathologist and fluency specialist I train people who stutter become 'wow' speakers. I must say I am very successful and that is why I always want to keep updated on public speaking skills. I must say that your course is the most comprehensive and straight to the point course. The content is very much similar to the courses I deliver but I enjoyed your passion, enthusiasm and also expertise. As you know lol, those are the secrets of public speaking. During our courses both of manage to change the fear into fun for public speaking. Once again, well done for the extremely wellorganizedcourse. It could not have been better :) keep up the good work.""

  Then we will learn various ways to import data, first coding steps including basic R functions, functions and loops and we will also take a look at the graphical tools.
 </p>
 <p>
  The whole course should take approx. 3 to 5 hours, and there are exercises available for you to try out R. You will also get the code I am using for the demos.

 <p>
  Anything is ready for you to enter the world of statistical programming.

  Learn key AI concepts and intuition training to get you quickly up to speed with all things AI. Covering:
  <br/>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   How to
   <strong>
    start building AI
   </strong>
   with no previous coding experience using Python
  </li>
  <li>
   How to
   <strong>

  </li>
  <li>
   How to
   <strong>
    optimize your AI
   </strong>
   to reach its maximum potential in the real world
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Here is what you will get with this course:
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   1. Complete beginner to expert AI skills
  </strong>
  – Learn to code self-improving AI for a range of purposes. In fact, we code together with you. Every tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   2. Code templates –
  </strong>
  Plus, you’ll get downloadable Python code templates for every AI you build in the course. This makes building truly unique AI as simple as changing a few lines of code. If you unleash your imagination, the potential is unlimited.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   3. Intuition Tutorials –
  </strong>
  Where most courses simply bombard you with dense theory and set you on your way, we believe in developing a deep understanding for not only what you’re doing, but why you’re doing it. That’s why we don’t throw complex mathematics at you, but focus on building up your intuition in coding AI making for infinitely better results down the line.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   4. Real-world solutions –
  </strong>
  You’ll achieve your goal in not only 1 game but in 3. Each module is comprised of varying structures and difficulties, meaning you’ll be skilled enough to build AI adaptable to any environment in real life, rather than just passing a glorified memory “test and forget” like most other courses. Practice truly does make perfect.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   5. In-course support –
  </strong>
  We’re fully committed to making this the most accessible and results-driven AI course on the planet. This requires us to be there when you need our help. That’s why we’ve put together a team of professional Data Scientists to support you in your journey, meaning you’ll get a response from us within 48 hours maximum.

 Ditch Auto &amp; learn how to take fantastic pictures with your DSLR Camera in Manual. Unlock your camera's true potential!
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <b>
  What you'll learn:
 </b>
 <br/>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Learn to use your camera in manual mode
  </li>
  <li>
   Feel more confident shooting with a DSLR
  </li>
  <li>
   Maximize the potential of your camera
  </li>
 </ul>
 <br/>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why Take This Course?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  You have a DSLR Camera or a fancy Point-and-shoot, but have not been using it to it's full potential. You know that the scary ""manual mode"" holds a whole new level of customization which would result in better quality photos but have resisted. Terms like Shutter Speed and Aperture sound confusing and you don't know where to start.
 </p>
 <p>
  If that sounds familiar, I want to assure you that by the end of my FREE course you will understand what those settings do and be on your way to controlling your camera rather than your camera controlling you.
 </p>
 <p>
  You made an investment in a decent camera and it's time to start using it's features
 </p>
 <p>
  In this course you will learn the basics of DSLR Photography and how to shoot in manual mode. My goal is to give you the tools so you can train your brain to think like a Photographer. You will also know how to control your camera instead of leaving it up to Auto Mode to try and to it's best.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   How Long Is This Course?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  So far, the course is just over 4 hours in length. You can watch it in chunks or all at once. It is best to watch it with camera in hand so you can pause and follow along with your camera. All DSLR Cameras are different so your settings may look different than mine.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What Should I Expect?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  You should expect to be able to shoot photos with confidence in pretty much all situations. Whether you are taking pictures of your kids for the memories or are considering Photography as a profession, this is everything I had to teach myself in order to understand my camera.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Who are you Jerad Hill?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  I am aWedding Photographerwith over 6 years of professional experience. I have shot over 200 weddings, 120 engagement sessions, 150 portrait sessions and 1000's of photos of my own kids. For fun I have shot live concerts and music videos. I am also aWedding Videographerand do a lot with video. Expect a course on DSLR Video soon.

  Welcome to learn, implement and master the course titled ""
  <strong>
   <em>
    Artificial Intelligence in Web Design (Special Edition)"".
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What this Special Edition Website Design course all about?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Website design is the art and science of building the look, feel, and how a website functions in a nutshell. This course is having clear, concise, and easy to use website design technologies and will ultimately lead to a better user experience for your custom audience or clients. There are many aspects of successful website design like HTML, colours, layouts, text size, graphics, and so much more. But, this course is a huge differentiator in the design field as it uses artificial intelligence-based website design state-of-the-art technologies that are covered nowhere in the world. If you've been wondering how to learn website design, you've come to the right place - after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why website design is needed for a successful online presence?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Having a good website is the backbone of every business and to achieve this successful feat, typically we need website design developers, content marketers, SEO specialists, etc. in an organization. But, some website design developers charge a lot of money outside in the market and other freelancing marketplaces to design websites using content management platforms like WordPress CMS. In fact, tools like Bookmark in website design will help advance your web-design career, altogether. This course is both a beginner's website design course and an advanced course for web developers.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Jobs in Website Design: Unveiled
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  According to Glassdoor, you can expect an average salary of $64,468 in the United States for doing website design. As your experience grows in website design all the time, you can expect to see higher salary ranges in the upcoming future. For example, you can expect an average Junior Website Designer to make around $62k in the United States alone and Rs. 2-3 Lakhs in India. As a Front End Website Design Developer, you can expect to make over $90k abroad.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Introduction to the website design course powered by Artificial Intelligence(AI) technology:
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  In the beginning website, design developers and designers designed websites using HTML. Soon, the internet was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep web, and the Spirit of Code was hovering over the pinnacle of utmost ignorance.
 </p>
 <p>
  We’ve come a long way from that time. The internet is still a dark, dreadful place, but it’s much more stylish, sophisticated, and amazing now. Website Design has grown exponentially in scale and sophistication over the last few years, thanks to new Artificial Intelligence-based website creation tools that are dominating the digital marketing industry.
 </p>
 <p>
  The technology is still in its infancy stage, however - but machine learning is enabling artificial design intelligence (ADI) to understand creative rules and apply them independently and in an intuitive and more attractive way - for that matter. Artificial design technology will soon be advanced enough to automate a lot of web design work in the near future too. New thought leaders would emerge and new courses like this would serve to be game-changers in the artificial intelligence-powered digital marketing space.

 </p>
 <p>
  You'll also learn that you're
  <strong>
   not limited to Angular
  </strong>
  or plain JavaScript/TypeScript projects. Instead, a complete module covers how you may
  <strong>
   use TypeScript with ReactJS
  </strong>
  and improve your React code with TypeScript as well.

 <p>
  <strong>
   Practice what you learn!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Watching videos is a great way to learn. And to a lot of students, it's the best way. If you also want to practice the things you learn, this course offers you more than that though. Because this course comes with plenty of exercises (and solutions, of course) in addition to all the high-quality learning videos.

 <p>
  <strong>
   So much Content!
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  I'm not a fan of these courses which teach you the basics and then leave you alone. Instead, in this course you'll get insights into:

  <strong>
   How important is database management in the age of big data and analytics?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  It is really important.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   How many employers would be happy to hire employees who can use data for the purposes of business intelligence?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  All of them.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   How many people have these skills?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Not enough.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is why now is the time to learn SQL and gain a competitive advantage in the job market. Remember, the average salary of a SQL developer is $103,400! That’s a lucrative career.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   How come?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, when you can work with SQL, it means you don’t have to rely on others sending you data and executing queries for you. You can do that on your own. This allows you to be independent and dig deeper into the data to obtain the answers to questions that might improve the way your company does its business. For instance, Database management is the foundation for data analysis and intelligent decision making.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Worried that you have no previous experience?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Not an issue. We will start from the very basics and gradually teach you everything you need to know. Step by step. With no steps skipped.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Why take this course in particular? Isn’t it like the rest of the SQL courses out there?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  We would like to think it isn’t. Our team worked hard to create a course that is:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Easy to understand
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Time efficient and concise
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Shows how SQL can be crucial for data analytics and business intelligence
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Comprehensive – it covers several topics not shown in other SQL courses
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Practical – it teaches you how to work with a real-life database
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Corresponds to professional best practices
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Taught in MySQL – The most popular SQL database management system
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Contains plenty of downloadable exercises, course notes, and quiz questions
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Some of these aspects have been covered in other courses. Others haven’t. However, no one provides such a variety of topics in one place.
 </p>
 <p>
  We firmly believe this course is the best training material out there. It is a truly interactive experience preparing you for a real-life working environment.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   We love teaching
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  So far, over 1,750,000 students have taken our courses here on Udemy. Teaching is what we do best, and we take pride in going the extra mile to create the most engaging content for you, our students. Our mission is to help you bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge taught at school and in universities and the practical application required at the workplace.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   So, why do you need to enroll in this course and learn SQL?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Salary/Income.
    </strong>
    As we pointed out earlier, learning SQL is a great opportunity. There is a significant surge in demand for skills revolving around database management, database administration, and business analysis relying on data. Companies will pay top dollars for specialists who have such know-how
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Profession of the future.
    </strong>
    In the years to come, data will only grow in importance and size. Therefore, it is great to pick up a skill that will likely increase in demand over the years to come
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Analytical reasoning.
    </strong>
    Programming languages are a great way to train your mind. Furthermore, understanding a business task and looking for its solution through writing code can be really interesting and stimulating once you become familiar with the basics
   </p>
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  <strong>
   What about certificates? Do you provide a certificate?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Upon completion of the course, you will be able to download a certificate of completion with your name on it. Then, you can upload this certificate on LinkedIn and show potential employers this is a skill you possess.
 </p>
 <p>
  Sounds awesome, right?

  <strong>
   A polite request
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Please
  </strong>
  watch the presentation video
  <strong>
   BEFORE
  </strong>
  joining the course; If you don't like what you see (or my accent at the time of recording) please
  <strong>
   DONOT
  </strong>
  enroll. I've seen many people enrolling (since, you know, it's FREE) and then leaving negative scores because they didn't fancy the accent of the instructor or because the course was
  <strong>
   ""too basic""
  </strong>
  (even though it's basically written everywhere that this is a foundation course for absolute beginners).
  <br/>
  So, don't be
  <strong>
   that guy/girl,
  </strong>
  and join only if you believe this course is right for you. If you don't like how the course is structured or its content please do not hesitate to leave a negative score but in doing so add a comment explaining your reasons; This will help the instructor. A negative score without any comment or feedback is not useful to anyone and detrimental to other potential students.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   This course was made in 2015
  </strong>
  and, apart from a few tweaks in 2016it hasn't seen further updates (that is one of the reasons why it's now offered for free). So, you won't find things like CSSFlexbox/Grid here. Though, its content is still super relevant nowadays andimportant in building a solid foundation in Front-End Development.No matter what latest technology you want to learn, you need the basics first and this is
  <strong>
   exactly
  </strong>
  what this course is for!
  <br/>
  <strong>
   <br/>
   - What is this course all about?
  </strong>
 </p>

  <strong>
   job
  </strong>
  , engaging, well paid and full of challenges and wonders.
 </p>

 <p>
  Front End Development is an area of Web Development that includes all of the skills required to create the visual and interactive part of a Website. It's a complex mix of skills and technologies and one of the most fast growing and well paid IT sectors of the moment.
 </p>
 <p>
  A Front End Developer is the link between the graphic designer, responsible for creating the visual design of a Web Application and the Backend Developer responsible for creating the computational logic behind the application. The Front End Developer brings the application to life creating rich, compelling experiences and allowing the user to interact with the data behind the application.
 </p>
 <p>
  This
  <strong>
   comprehensive course
  </strong>
  is aimed at students with no previous experience with Web Development or programming at all;

 </p>
 <p>
  The course was recorded on a
  <strong>
   Mac OSX
  </strong>
  machine; You can still benefit from this course if you're using Windows but you are required to have basic knowledge on how to use the Windows Explorer and create folders and files with it. You can easily avoid using the Windows command prompt (in the very rare videos that use the Terminal) and instead do what the video shows just using your WIndows Explorer (it's mostly creating folders and files).

  <strong>
   Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education materialshould teach real life skills that are current andthey should not waste a student's valuable time.

  Here’s the truth: Most courses teach you Python and do just that. They show you how to get started. But the thing is you don’t know where to go from there or how to build your own projects.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  Whether you are new to programming, or want to level up your Python skills, or are coming from a different programming language, this course is for you. This course is not about making you just code along without understanding the principles so that when you are done with the course you don’t know what to do other than watch another tutorial. No!
  <strong>
   This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute beginner with no coding experience to someone that can go off, forget about me, and build their own applications and get hired.

  AndreiNeagoie is the instructor of the
  <strong>
   highest rated Development courses on Udemy as well asone of the fastestgrowing.
  </strong>
  His graduates havemovedon to work forsome of the biggest techcompanies around the world like Apple, Google, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc...Hehasbeen working as a senior software developer inSilicon Valley and Toronto for many years,andis now taking all that he has learned,to teachprogramming skills andto help youdiscover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows inlife.
 </p>
 <p>
  Having beena self taught programmer,he understands that there is anoverwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and booksthat are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills.Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp.
  <strong>
   Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education materialshould teach real life skills that are current andthey should not waste a student's valuable time.
  </strong>
  Having learned importantlessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to evenfounding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time toteaching others valuablesoftware development skillsin order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.
 </p>
 <p>
  Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained.
  <strong>
   He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.

  <strong>
   Why should you take this course?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  So you saw that the course is absolutely full-packed with content. But maybe you're still not sure if you should actually learn advanced CSS?
 </p>
 <p>
  That's probably because CSS is so easy to get started with. In fact, most developers highly underestimate the importance and power of CSS. But nothing could be further away from the truth!
 </p>
 <p>
  CSS is what makes our design come to life. And there is so much we can do with it! Mastering advanced techniques like flexbox, CSS grid, and animations, will give you an edge over many CSS developers out there who still use outdated methods.
 </p>
 <p>
  Plus, CSS can become a real nightmare when you try to master it, and when youhave to maintain large projects. So having a good grasp on fundamental concepts is an absolute must for any serious front-end developer.
 </p>
 <p>
  And this course will help you with allthat!
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   So, should you take this course? The answer is most likely a big YES!
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  And I packed so much content into this course, that no matter if you're just starting out, or if you're already an experienced front-end developer, there is definitely gonna be something for you in this course.

  <strong>
   Welcome to the Bootstrap &amp; jQuery – Certification Course for Beginners
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  With over 64% of the world using mobile devices to browse web pages, it’s no surprise that Bootstrap and jQuery have become the industry leaders in front-end scripting languages.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This course starts right from the foundational concepts and gradually progresses to intermediate topics. Through a project-style learning approach, students will have the opportunity to build mobile-responsive web pages, complete with animation and interactivity.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   Bootstrap Section:
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  Students are taught to use the Bootstrap framework for responsive, mobile-first - front-end development. As one of the leading open-source development libraries, Bootstrap is an essential part of the developers coding arsenal. The section begins with teaching students how to include essential Bootstrap files into web pages. It then explores the Bootstrap Grid system and popular layout strategies for optimal cross-device and cross-browser compatibility.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Students gain exposure to just about every Bootstrap component, from typography, tables and images, to jumbotrons, wells, alerts, buttons, glyphicons and progress bars. The section includes several hands-on exercises that will walk students through the process of creating stunning layouts, complete with modals, carousels, popovers, drop-down menus, forms and much more.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <strong>
   jQuery Section:
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  We explores the jQuery library and many of its unique features, used to create stunning, animated web pages. We start with the basics, from embedding jQuery into web pages to working with Selectors. Students then explore working with events, toggling, fading, sliding, and other forms of animation. The lessons also teach students how to work with callbacks, chaining, dragables, accordion menus and many other functions.

   Welcome to the JavaScript &amp; jQuery – Certification Course for Beginners
   <br/>
   <br/>
  </strong>
  This course offers a comprehensive guide into the fundamentals of coding using JavaScript and jQuery. These powerful languages can be used to add animated, dynamic client-side functionality to any web page.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The JavaScript section of the course takes students on a journey that starts right from the basics. This includes JavaScript placement, and embedding External JavaScript code. From there, we move into variable declaration and operators for performing arithmetic. We also look at the order of operations, and different data types. Students then move into more advanced topics such as:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    JavaScript Objects
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Arrays, and Array Attributes
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Conditional Statements
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    JavaScript Comparisons and Booleans
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    JavaScript Loops, Functions, and Events
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The second section of the course takes an in-depth look into jQuery. This is where students can take their development skills to the next level, by adding interactivity to static elements. We start with foundational concepts such as embedding jQuery, and various selectors. We then explore jQuery events, Animations, complex functions, and much more.

  As a computer science teacher, I noticed that IP addressing was one of the most intimidating topics for my students, and yet, it's so simple for those who truly get to understand it.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  My goal here was to create a course that is as simple as possible, and therefore, easy to understand for everyone, including those who are just beginning their journey into computer networks. One thing I added (that I haven't seen in the other courses) is summarization - this topic may not be interesting to beginners, but if you plan on getting familiar with advanced routing techniques, you may want to practice summarization.

  Durante esse anos emque tive a oportunidade de oferecer cursose suporte na plataformaWordPress, percebi que a maioria das pessoasdesistemde criar seus sites antes mesmo da instalação,provavelmente devido aos conceitos mais técnicoscomo registro de domínio, servidores, FTP e banco de dados que antecedem essa etapa.
 </p>
 <p>
  Por conta disso decidi criar o curso WordPress Expresso, onde você irá aprender aconstruiros seus próprios sites emWordPressde umaforma simples e rápida utilizando o servidor da Umbler.
 </p>
 <p>
  Não será necessário se preocupar com assinatura de servidores, envio de arquivos via FTP e banco de dados complexos,uma vez que a Umbler faz tudo isso.

   #3 The actual instructor answers ALL QUESTIONS. The unfortunate truth is that on Udemy
  </strong>
  most instructors do not answer questions at all even though Udemy provides a spot in the course for that. How disappointing. Other instructors have a ""Team"" that is really a low cost outsource provider who answers questions and provides general 1 or 2 sentence answers, if that. What a rip off. The instructor in this course answers all questions with detailed responses and provides supplemental links and resources to support the answer. Many students like to go though and read the Q&amp;A and consider it like a blog that really aids learning on its own.

 Linux for Networking Engineers (CCNA, CCNP, CCIE etc). Practical Linux with GNS3 = network programmability &amp; automation
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <b>
  What you'll learn:
 </b>
 <br/>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Learn foundational Linux skills
  </li>
  <li>
   Learn how to practically use Linux in your networks
  </li>
  <li>
   Build Linux networks using GNS3
  </li>
 </ul>
 <br/>
 <p>
  It is important for you as a network engineer to learn Linux!
 </p>
 <p>
  Why? There are many reasons including:
 </p>
 <p>
  1) A lot of network operating systems are based on Linux, or have a Linux shell you can access, or use Linux type commands. I'll show you an example using Cisco, Arista and Cumulus Linux.
 </p>
 <p>
  2) Network Automation tools such as Ansible don't run the command node on Windows. You are probably going to use Linux with tools such as Ansible, Netmkio, NAPALM and other network automation tools.
 </p>
 <p>
  3) SDN controllers such as OpenDaylight, ONOS, RYU and APIC-EM run on Linux.You will find that many SDN tools require Linux.
 </p>
 <p>
  4) DevOps tools such as git work best with Linux.
 </p>
 <p>
  5) IoT devices typically run Linux
 </p>
 <p>
  6) A new breed of network devices from companies like Facebook, Microsoft and Cumulus Linux use Linux.
 </p>
 <p>
  There are even more reasons, but make sure you don't get left behind! You as a network engineer start learning Linux.
 </p>
 <p>
  This course teaches foundational Linux knowledge without assuming that you have any Linux experience. Learn practically with GNS3!
 </p>
 <p>
  Learn how to configure Linux networking, how to create users and assign permissions, how to install and run Linux services such as DNS and DHCP.
 </p>
 <p>
  The course uses various GNS3 topologies with devices such as:
 </p>
 <p>
  1) Linux Docker containers
 </p>
 <p>
  2) Linux GNS3 QEMU virtual machines
 </p>
 <p>
  3) Traditional Linux virtual mahcines
 </p>
 <p>
  4) Network devices - you could use Cisco, Arista, Cumulus Linux or others
 </p>
 <p>
  Do you want to see something else added to the course? Just let me know. I like to get your feedback on ways I can improve the course and add more content that you think is relevant.
 </p>
 <p>
  Networking is changing. Make sure you keep up to date!
 </p>
 <p>
  All the very best!

 </p>
 <p>
  By the end of the course, we'll of course also go through all steps required to get it into an app store.

 A complete productivity and time management course designed to help you reduce your overwhelm and increase your results.
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <b>
  What you'll learn:
 </b>
 <br/>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Take control of their mindset and energy levels to increase your productivity
  </li>
  <li>
   Discover why you are not as productive as you could be and develop a plan to improve

 <br/>
 <p>
  If you have more things to do than you have time and frequently get overwhelmed with all your priorities and tasks, you are in the right place! I designed this course to help people from all walks of life that struggle with trying to get it all done.
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  At the same time I have done my best to design this course as efficiently as possible since time is our most precious resource.
 </p>
 <p>
  This course is going to be focused into three areas or sections. Each is designed to build on the other, but each lecture is labeled by concept clearly, so you will also be able to come back and hit specific topics that are most helpful for you.
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  In our first section we are going to focus on what is causing our overwhelm and what leads us to procrastination.
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  In our second section, we build the foundation for a new level of productivity and cover the fundamentals and key concepts that must be mastered in order to really get the results you want and to be a master of productivity. If you don’t start with the right fundamentals, even the best tricks and hacks won’t be fully utilized.
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  And finally in our last section we will build on the foundation we created by implementing proven productivity and time management tactics and strategies to really make a dramatic improvement in your productivity.
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  Here is what some of my students have to say about the course.

 <b>
  What you'll learn:
 </b>
 <br/>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Launch a Live Website Landing Page
  </li>
 </ul>
 <br/>
 <p>
  Remember when you couldn't walk? Of course not. Who can?
 </p>
 <p>
  Learning to code is much like learning to walk...except it happens much later in life.
 </p>
 Never coded before? No problem.
 <p>
  Entrepreneurs like you are a rare breed. You create incredible businesses and come up with ideas that change the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  Technology has made the 21st century, the century of the entrepreneur. Thanks to the power of the internet, you can reach a global audience in minutes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The question is...do you have the skills to be able to take advantage of this incredible opportunity?
 </p>
 <p>
  If you're starting (or have started) a business in today's tech driven economy, then you've got to understand the code that's driving your business.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Imagine asking others to create your software but you've no idea how it works?
  </li>
  <li>
   Imagine not knowing the time and effort involved in realizing your idea?
  </li>
  <li>
   Imagine having an incredible idea but you don't have the skills to get it started?
  </li>
 </ul>
 I'm Not Going To Teach You Tons of Coding Languages...
 <p>
  Instead of spending infinity boring you with the intricacies of a multitude of languages, Coding For Entrepreneurs will teach you the exact languages you need to know to launch any type of eCommerce site &amp; build landing pages that convert browsers into buyers.
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <strong>
   best way to learn is by doing
  </strong>
  - you'll never learn anything if you sit and watch videos or read a PDF all day. We get you into action and enable you to achieve results immediately.
 </p>
 <p>
  You'll get in introduction in:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Python
  </li>
  <li>
   Django
  </li>
  <li>
   HTML
  </li>
  <li>
   CSS
  </li>
 </ul>
 Don't worry if these look scary...if you can multiply and add numbers then you can code!
 <p>
  Coding is extremely logical. Take Python for example - it reads just like the English language less a couple of odd characters.
 </p>
 <p>
  We Put Special Emphasis On Django...Why?
  <br/>
 </p>
 <strong>
  - Django is based in Python
 </strong>
 <br/>
 - It's fast, simple, effective, secure, and ideal for ""perfectionists with deadlines""
 <br/>
 <strong>
  - Built-In User Login (authentication) System
 </strong>
 <br/>
 - Web-based Admin system (built - in)
 <br/>
 <strong>
  - Template system that allows basic knowledge of HTML/CSS to design the front-end.
 </strong>
 <br/>
 - Growing Community for Help/Advice/Best Practices .... and freelance clients (or jobs).
 <br/>
 <strong>
  - Easy to implement &amp; Launch
 </strong>
 <br/>
 But I've Been Told That I Need To Learn C, C#, Objective C and Java?
 <p>
  The truth is that you could learn all of these languages and use them to further enhance your coding.
 </p>
 <p>
  But why bother?
 </p>
 <p>
  You're an entrepreneur, NOT a professional coder. Would you rather learn how to code something quickly and start building your business empire or spend years debugging something that may never launch?
 </p>
 <p>
  It's time to take your future into your own hands and learn how to start Coding For Entrepreneurs today!

  React Native is an excellent solution for developing apps on mobile in a fraction of the time it takes to make an equivalent iOS or Swift app. You'll love seeing your changes instantly appear on your own device, rather than waiting for Swift/Java code to recompile! This quick feedback loop, along with excellent cross platform support, is what has catapulted React Native to the top must-have skill for Javascript engineers.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you are new to React, or if you've been working to learn it but sometimes feel like you still don't quite 'get it', this is the React course for you! To learn React you have to understand it.
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    Learn how to use React's custom markup language, JSX, to clean up your Javascript code
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Master the process of breaking down a complex component into many smaller, interchangeable components
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Grasp the difference between “props"" and “state"" and when to use each
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Render interactive, media-rich components in beautifully styled apps
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Develop apps that are unique, fun, and responsive
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Build on
    <strong>
     both Android and iOS
    </strong>
    platforms
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Master integration with
    <strong>
     Firebase for user authentication
    </strong>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    Learn the core principles of
    <strong>
     navigation
    </strong>
    with React Native
   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  I've built the course that I would have wanted to take when I was learning React Native. A course that explains the concepts and how they're implemented in the best order for you to learn and deeply understand them.

  “[Mike] Meyers is amazing when it comes to explaining. His fun little bits, such as when he explains common problems and how to troubleshoot them, keep you engaged and help it stick so much better. I went from barely understanding little bits here and there to passing the 1001 on my first try with the help of this course. …If you have tried reading the books and listening to lectures from people who sound like the teacher from Ferris Bueller then I would highly recommend this course paired with his practice tests.” – Robert F.

    WHY SHOULD I TAKE THIS COURSE?
   </em>
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Technology is ranked as the #1 source of U.S. jobs. Are you looking to kickstart your career, improve your existing IT skills, or increase your chances of getting that IT job? Did you know 96% of HR managers use IT certifications as screening or hiring criteria during recruitment?
 </p>
 <p>
  Some jobs that use A+ certifications are Support Specialists (avg.
  <strong>
   $54,500/yr.
  </strong>
  ), Field Service Technicians (avg.
  <strong>
   $46,000/yr.
  </strong>
  ), and Desktop Support Analysts (avg.
  <strong>
   $60,000/yr
  </strong>
  .).

 <p>
  <strong>

 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    A+ Cert with no other certifications =
    <strong>
     $47,500/yr.
    </strong>
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    A+ Cert with 1 or 2 other active certs. =

   </p>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Not looking for a cert? Maybe you're just interested in how to keep your home network router from constantly doing that annoying red-blinky-light thing. Or be the family hero and set up that awesome smart thermostat you've had in your Amazon cart for a year! Or perhaps you want to learn how to get your iPhone to work so you don't have to keep asking your friend's brother's aunt's niece for help. Whatever your motivation, this course is perfect to help give you a robust IT foundational knowledge in a way that's easy-to-understand. And, hopefully, you'll have a few laughs with me along the way.

   Why Learn from Me
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  In this course,
  <strong>
   you won’t just gain the book smarts to pass the exam. You’ll also hone your hands-on skills to succeed as a network engineer in the real world.
  </strong>
  I’m a professional instructor who has been entrusted by Cisco since 2007 to develop and deliver training courses for their own engineers and partners. I’ve also designed multiple training courses for the largest service providers in the Asia Pacific region such as IBM, Verizon, and the Australian National Broadband Network. I’ve spent years distilling my decade’s worth of networking experience from the field into mentoring and supporting other systems engineers, and I’m passionate about passing my knowledge of Cisco networks onto others.
 </p>
 <p>
  As a student in this course, you’ll get lifetime access to the course materials and answers to every question you ask in the Q&amp;A board. I love interacting with my students: anything you want to know, please ask. The course also comes with an unconditional risk-free 30 day money-back guarantee–that's my personal promise of your success.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Value
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   If you take a comparable course at a training centre it will cost you thousands of dollars,
  </strong>
  and when it’s over you can’t experience the tutorials again or ask the instructor any more questions. When you take my course you can learn anytime you want in the comfort of your own home, and I’m always here for you whenever you need any help.
 </p>
 <p>
  Not sure about the best way to pay for this course? Ask your manager at work if they’ll expense it. They won’t have to pay the large fees of traditional classroom learning or have to cover your absence for a week. They get
  <strong>
   huge value from this investment in your future.
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  When you’re done with the course, you’ll have everything you need to crush the Cisco CCNA exam. I’m excited to share all of my knowledge with you.
 </p>

   Learn from Google or from this Course?
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  I've been there! I first learnt VBA from Google.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was truly a light-bulb moment, when I realized that Google has some answers - it could give me some of the code I was looking for - but there two things missing:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <p>
    <em>
     The WHY
    </em>
    - why does the code work in one situation but not another.
   </p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <em>
     Structure
    </em>
    - topic sequence, real-case examples, workbooks, documentation.
   </p>
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Don’t waste your time
  </strong>
 </p>
 <p>
  Don't waste your time on poor quality videos and confusing explanations. In this ExcelVBA course,complex topics are taught in a simple way by an instructor with 17 years of experience. The contenthas been carefully crafted and clearly organized.The videos are high quality andincludeanimations to emphasize points. Most importantlyyou learn VBAbydoing.

   ""I have already tried some VBA classes but so far I was never able to apply what I learnt to my own work. This course is different. I have already used some of the techniques Leila is teaching and applied it to my work files. I was able to reduce manual work for me and my colleagues by creating my own macros from scratch. Highly recommended!!!""

  -- Randy Taylor
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   ""Leila is the real deal... there are many VBA courses on Udemy (some of which I've taken) that merely demonstrate the functionalities. Leila explains the important foundation concepts and how the model is set up allowing you to truly create VBA code from thought rather than copying and pasting from various places. Her class is professionally constructed, with resources and content for each lecture, practice content for you to try things yourself and good Q&amp;A opportunities to answer specific questions. Trust me, this is the course you want to take.""
