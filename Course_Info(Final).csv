<strong>
           COMPLETELY REDONE WITH OVER 500 BRAND NEWVIDEOS!
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Hi! Welcome to the brand new version of The Web Developer Bootcamp, Udemy's most popular web development course. This course was just completely overhauled to prepare students for the 2023 job market, with over 60 hours of brand new content. This is the
          <strong>
           only course you need to learn web development.
          </strong>
          There are a lot of options for online developer training, but this course is without a doubt the most comprehensive and effective on the market. Here's why:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            This is the only Udemy course taught by a professional bootcamp instructor with a track record of success.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             94% of my in-person bootcamp students go on to get full-time developer jobs
            </strong>
            . Most of them are complete beginners when I start working with them.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            The previous 2 bootcamp programs that I taught cost
            <strong>
             $14,000 and $21,000
            </strong>
            . This course is just as comprehensive but with brand new content for a fraction of the price.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Everything I cover is up-to-date and relevant to 2022's developer job market.
            <strong>
             This course does not cut any corners. I just spent 8 months redoing this behemoth of a course!
            </strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            We build 13+ projects, including a
            <strong>
             gigantic production application
            </strong>
            called YelpCamp. No other course walks you through the creation of such a substantial application.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            The course is
            <strong>
             constantly updated
            </strong>
            with new content, projects, and modules. Think of it as a subscription to a never-ending supply of developer training.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            You get to meet my cats and chickens!
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
          When you're learning to program you often have to sacrifice learning the exciting and current technologies in favor of the ""beginner friendly"" classes. With this course, you get the best of both worlds. This is a course designed for the complete beginner, yet it covers some of the most exciting and relevant topics in the industry.
         </p>
<p>
          Throughout the brand new version of the course we cover tons of tools and technologies including:

<p>
          ""Angela is just incredible, awesome and just fantastic in this course. I've never had such an instructor;
          <strong>
           detailed
          </strong>
          in every aspect of the course, gives precise explanations, gives you the anxiety to learn etc. She's got that ability to make fun while explaining things for better understanding. I really love this course."" - Ekeu MonkamUlrich
         </p>
<p>
          ""Angela is very thorough without ever being boring. I've taken MANY online courses in my life including my Bachelors and Masters degrees. She is by far the best instructor I've ever had. This course is
          <strong>
           packed with thousands of dollars worth of great instruction
          </strong>
          , and paced well enough for anyone to pick coding up and run with it- Thank you!"" - J Carlucci
         </p>
<p>
          ""Love the way Angela explains things. Easy to follow and full of logic. I can say she must spend a lot of energy creating this great course. Thank you and I recommend it to all who's interested in coding!"" - Yiqing Zheng
         </p>
<p>
          ""So far (on my third day) this course has taught me
          <strong>
           more than I was able to learn in multiple other programming courses
          </strong>
          . This course is clearly outlined and builds upon itself gradually in an easy to understand way."" - Normal Ramsey
         </p>
<p>
          ""It's a different approach to teaching Web Development. I like that you are
          <strong>
           given everything possible to succeed
          </strong>
          from the onset."" - Ronick Thomas
         </p>
<p>
          The tutor is simply AMAZING, by far the best tutor I have ever had. I would give her 10 stars out of 5. She is not just punching the code and talking to herself, but she is actually explaining things. She keeps on giving really useful hints and she will give you a great load of other references. I always knew what I was doing and why I was doing it. All the extra challenges have just made me remember and understand things better. - Peter Dlugos

<p>
          JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world. It powers the entire modern web. It provides millions of high-paying jobs all over the world.
         </p>
<p>
          That's why you want to learn JavaScript too. And you came to the right place!
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why is this the right JavaScript course for you?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
           This is the most complete and in-depth JavaScript course on Udemy (and maybe the entire internet!). It's an all-in-one package that will take you from the very fundamentals of JavaScript, all the way to building modern and complex applications.
          </em>
</p>
<p>
          You will learn modern JavaScript from the very beginning, step-by-step. I will guide you through
          <strong>
           practical and fun code examples
          </strong>
          ,
          <strong>
           important theory
          </strong>
          about how JavaScript works behind the scenes, and
          <strong>
           beautiful and complete projects
          </strong>
          .
         </p>
<p>
          You will become ready to continue learning advanced
          <strong>
           front-end frameworks
          </strong>
          like React, Vue, Angular, or Svelte.
         </p>
<p>
          You will also learn how to think like a developer, how to plan application features, how to architect your code, how to debug code, and a lot of other real-world skills that you will need on your developer job.
         </p>
<p>
          And unlike other courses, this one actually contains beginner, intermediate, advanced, and even expert topics, so
          <strong>
           you don't have to buy any other course in order to master JavaScript
          </strong>
          from the ground up!
         </p>
<p>
          But... You don't have to go into all these topics. This is a huge course, because, after all, it's ""The Complete JavaScript Course"". In fact, it's like many courses in one!
          <strong>
           But you can become an excellent developer by watching only parts of the course
          </strong>
          . That's why I built this course in a very modular way, and designed pathways that will take you through the course faster.
         </p>
<p>
<em>
           By the end of the course, you will have the knowledge and confidence that you need in order to ace your job interviews and become a professional developer.

          My name is Jonas, I'm an experienced web developer and designer, and one of Udemy's top instructors. I have been teaching this bestselling course since 2016 to over 700,000 developers, always listening to feedback and understanding exactly how students actually learn.
         </p>
<p>
          I know how students learn JavaScript and what they need in order to master it. And with that knowledge, I designed the ideal course curriculum.
          <strong>
           It's a unique blend of real-world projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges
          </strong>
          , that will take you from zero to an expert and confident JavaScript developer in just a couple of weeks.
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           So what exactly is covered in the course?
          </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            Build 5 beautiful real-world projects for your portfolio! In these projects, you will learn how to plan and architect your applications using flowcharts and common JavaScript patterns
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Master the JavaScript fundamentals: variables, if/else, operators, boolean logic, functions, arrays, objects, loops, strings, and more
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Learn modern JavaScript (ES6+) from the beginning: arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator, default arguments, optional chaining, and more
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            How JavaScript works behind the scenes: engines, the call stack, hoisting, scoping, the 'this' keyword, reference values, and more.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Deep dive into functions: arrow functions, first-class and higher-order functions, bind, and closures.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Deep dive into object-oriented programming: prototypal inheritance, constructor functions (ES5), classes (ES6), encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. [This is like a small standalone course]
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Deep dive into asynchronous JavaScript: the event loop, promises, async/await, and error handling. You will use these to access data from third-party APIs with AJAX calls. [This is like a small standalone course]
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Learn modern tools that are used by professional web developers: NPM, Parcel (module bundler), Babel, and ES6 modules
           </p>
</li>
</ul>

<strong>
           Why would you choose to learn Java?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          The reality is that there is a lot of computer languages out there. It's in the hundreds. Why would you choose the Java language?
         </p>
<p>
          The number one reason is its popularity. According to many official websites that track the popularity of languages, Java is in the top 3 most popular languages worldwide in 2022.  Popularity means more companies and their staff are using it, so there are more career opportunities available for you if you are skilled in the language.
         </p>
<p>
          The last thing you want to do is pick a language that is not in mainstream use. Java came out in the 1990s and is still very popular today and continually updated by the owners, Oracle, over 30 years later.
         </p>

<p>
<strong>
           Are you aiming to get your first Java Programming job but struggling to find out what skills employers want
          </strong>
          and which course will give you those skills?
          <br/>
<br/>
          This course is designed to give you the Java skills you need to get a job as a Java developer. By the end of the course, you will understand Java extremely well and be able to build your own Java apps and be productive as a software developer.
          <br/>
<br/>
          Lots of students have been successful in getting their first job or promotion after going through the course.
          <br/>
<br/>
          Here is just one example of a student who lost her job and despite having never coded in her life previously, got a full-time software developer position in just a few months after starting this course. She didn't even complete the course!
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>
           ""
          </strong>
          Three months ago I lost my job, came to a turning point in my life, and finally made the drastic decision to completely change course. I decided to switch career paths and go into coding. My husband found and gave me your Complete Java Masterclass at Udemy as a gift, and I wholeheartedly dove into it as a lifeline. Following your course has been absolutely enjoyable (still working on it, not yet finished), and has been a great way of keeping on course, dedicated and motivated. Yesterday, three months after starting the course, and honestly to my surprise, I received (and accepted!) a job offer as a full-time developer. I wanted to just drop you a line to say thank you for doing this work, for being such a dedicated teacher, and for putting all this knowledge available out there in such an approachable way. It has, literally, been life-changing.
          <strong>
           With gratitude, Laura""
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
          The course is a whopping 100 hours long.
          <strong>
           Perhaps you have looked at the size of the course and are feeling a little overwhelmed at the prospect of finding time to complete it. Maybe you are wondering if you need to go through it all?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Firstly, Laura's story above shows that you do not have to complete the entire course - she was yet to complete the course when she accepted her developer job offer.
         </p>
<p>
          Secondly, the course is designed as a one-stop shop for Java.
         </p>
<p>
          The core java material you need to learn java development is covered in the first seven sections (around 14 hours in total). TheJava Basics are covered in those sections. The rest of the course covers intermediate, advanced, and optional material you do not technically need to go through.
          <br/>
<br/>
          For example section 13 is a whopping 10 hours just by itself and is aimed at those students who want to build desktop applications with graphical user interfaces. JavaFX(which is the technology used in this section) is something that most java developers will rarely or never need to work on. So you could skip that section entirely. But if you are one of the few that need to build user interfaces, then the content is there and ready for you. And there are other sections you can completely avoid if you wish.
         </p>
<p>
          If you want to know absolutely everything about Java, then you can go through the entire course if you wish, but it's not necessary to do so if you are just looking to learn the essential information to get a java developer position.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           What version of Java should you learn?
           <br/>
<br/>
</strong>
          Generally speaking, you would want to learn the very latest version of a computer programming language, but
          <strong>
           that's not the case
          </strong>
<strong>
           with Java.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Oracle, the owner of Java release many versions of Java. Some are released and expire in six months, with no future updates or support. Other versions have long-term support, for many years.
         </p>
<p>
          You can probably see why learning a version of Java that has expired makes no sense, and is likely a waste of time.
         </p>
<p>
          A company using Java technology(big or small) is not going to use a version of Java that has no updates or support. They will stick to stable, well-supported versions of Java that get updates.
         </p>
<p>
          Right now, in December 2022, the version of Java that offers this long-term support(LTS) is Java 17 - It's being fully supported until at least 2029 and likely will be extended from there.
         </p>
<p>
          As such, you want to learn the version of Java that your future employer will use, and that'sJava 17.
         </p>
<p>
          The course will also be updated in the future as new LTS versions are announced by Oracle.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           BOTTOMLINE:You will learn the RIGHT VERSIONof JAVA in this course! Right meaning the right version to maximize your future Java potential with clients or Employers.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>
           Will this course give me core java skills?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Yes, it will. CoreJava is the fundamental part of the Java JDK (the java development kit) that programmers need to learn to move onto other more advanced technologies.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why should you take this course?
          </strong>
<br/>
<br/>
          It's been a best-seller since its release on Udemy, you would be joining over 742,000 students who are already enrolled in the course.
         </p>
<p>
          There are well over 174,000 reviews left by students. It's rated as the best course to learn Java for beginners.
          <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
           What makes this course a bestseller?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Like you, thousands of others were frustrated and fed up with fragmented Youtube tutorials or incomplete or outdated courses which assume you already know a bunch of stuff, as well as thick, college-like textbooks able to send even the most caffeine-fuelled coder to sleep.
         </p>
<p>
          Like you, they were tired of low-quality lessons, poorly explained topics, and confusing info presented in the wrong way. That’s why so many find success in this complete Java developer course. It’s designed with simplicity and seamless progression in mind through its content.
          <br/>
<br/>
          This course assumes
          <strong>
           no previous coding experience
          </strong>
          and takes you from absolute beginner core concepts, like showing you the free tools you need to download and install, to writing your very first Java program. You will learn the core java skills you need to become employable in around 14 hours, and if you choose to, can take advantage of all the additional content in the course. It's a one-stop shop to learn java. If you want to go beyond the core content you can do so at any time.

</ul>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
            “AP-what?”
           </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
          Don't worry if none of that made sense. I go into great detail explaining each and every core concept, programming term, and buzzwords you need to create your own Java programs.
         </p>
<p>
          This truly is Java for complete beginners.
         </p>
<p>
          By the end of this comprehensive course, you’ll master Java programming no matter what level of experience you’re at right now. You’ll understand what you are doing, and why you are doing it. This isn’t a recipe book, you’ll use your own creativity to make unique, intuitive programs.
         </p>
<p>
          Not only do these HD videos show you how to become a programmer in great detail, but this course includes a unique
          <strong>
           challenge feature
          </strong>
          . Each time a core concept is taught, a video presents a challenge for you to help you understand what you have just learned in a
          <em>
           real-world scenario.
          </em>
</p>
<p>
          You’ll go and complete the challenge on your own, then come back and see the answers which I then explain in detail in a video, allowing you to check your results and identify any areas you need to go back and work on.
         </p>
<p>
          This is a proven way to help you
          <em>
           understand
          </em>
          Java faster and ensure you reach your goal of becoming a Java Developer in record time. Remember doing those old past exam papers in high school or college? It’s the same concept, and it works.

          As your instructor, I have close to

          <em>
           (I’ve taught students younger than that)
          </em>
          . Meaning not only can I teach this content with great simplicity, but I can make it fun too!

          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          ""This course was a guiding light in my ""Becoming a developer"" path from the first step. It helped me become a much more educated developer comparing to my friend who learned to code from trial/error. It's still a guide for me. every now and then I will come back to this course to learn something new or to improve what I've learned somewhere else. A BIG Thanks to ""Tim Buchalka"" my Master."" - Sina Jz
          <br/>
<br/>
          ""I was an absolute beginner when I started this course, and now I can write some good small advanced clean codes. I wrote a code and showed it to a programmer, and he was shocked, he told me that I'm more than ready to start a programming career."" - Amirreza Moeini
          <br/>
<br/>
          ""I am taking this class in conjunction with a Java 101 college class. I have learned more in one afternoon of videos from this class than I have in 4 weeks of a college class. Tim actually explains what things are and why they do what they do, as opposed to my college instructor that mainly said ""go make a program that does *whatever*"" and then I had to figure out a program that would meet those requirements but not actually learning why it worked."" - Stacy Harris
          <br/>
</p>
<p>
          It’s safe to say my students are thrilled with this course, and more importantly, their results,
          <em>
           and you can be too
          </em>
          …
         </p>
<p>
          This complete Java course will teach you everything you need to know in order to code awesome, profitable projects,
          <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
           Is the course updated?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          As mentioned above, yes.
         </p>
<p>
          It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New, more powerful hardware and software are being released
          <em>
           every day
          </em>
          , meaning it’s crucial to stay on top with the latest knowledge.
          <br/>
<br/>
          A lot of other courses on Udemy get released once, and never get updated. Learning an older version of Java can be counterproductive - you could be learning the ""old way"" of doing things, rather than using current technology.
          <br/>
<br/>
          Make sure you check the last updated date on the page of any course you plan to buy - you will be shocked to see some have not been updated for years.
          <br/>
<br/>
          That’s why I’m always adding new, up-to-date content to this course at
          <strong>
           no extra charge
          </strong>
          . Buy this course once, and you’ll have lifetime access to it and any future updates (which are on the way as we speak).
          <br/>
<br/>
          And when I say updated, I also mean enhanced. With the recently released Java 17 update, a lot of the content has changed to actually include features included in Java 17. This is not just a ""rebadged"" update - the content is updated with new features of Java. Videos are actually re-recorded, etc.
          <br/>
<br/>
          With this complete Java Masterclass, you will always have updated, relevant content.
         </p>

<em>
            What if I have questions?
           </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
          As if this course wasn’t complete enough, I offer
          <strong>
           full support
          </strong>
          , answering any questions you have
          <strong>
           7 days a week
          </strong>
          (whereas many instructors answer just once per week,
          <em>
           or not at all
          </em>
          ).
         </p>

<em>
           The instructor, Max, is very enthusiastic and engaging. He does a great job of explaining what he's doing and why rather than having students just mimic his coding. Max was also very responsive to questions. I would recommend this course and any others that he offers. Thanks, Max!
          </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
           As a person new to both JavaScript and Angular 2 I found this course extremely helpful because Max does a great job of explaining all the important concepts behind the code. Max has a great teaching ability to focus on what his audience needs to understand.
          </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           This Course uses TypeScript
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          TypeScript is the main language used by the official Angularteam and the language you'll mostly see in Angular tutorials. It's a superset to JavaScript and makes writing Angularapps really easy. Using it ensures, that you will have the best possible preparation for creating Angularapps. Check out the free videos for more information.
         </p>
<p>
          TypeScript knowledge is, however, not required - basic JavaScript knowledge is enough.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why Angular?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Angularis the next big deal. Being the successor of the overwhelmingly successful Angular.js framework it’s bound to shape the future of frontend development in a similar way. The powerful features and capabilities of Angularallow you to create complex, customizable, modern, responsive and user friendly web applications.
         </p>
<p>
          Angular 13simply is the latest version of the Angular framework and simply an update to Angular 2.
         </p>
<p>
          Angular is faster than Angular 1 and offers a much more flexible and modular development approach. After taking this course you’ll be able to fully take advantage of all those features and start developing awesome applications immediately.
         </p>
<p>
          Due to the drastic differences between Angular 1 and Angular(=Angular 13)you don’t need to know anything about Angular.js to be able to benefit from this course and build your futures projects with Angular.
         </p>

<strong>
           Do you want the opportunity to put your apps on over 1 billion devices?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          ""Become An Android Developer From Scratch” is designed to be the best first step to launching your career as an Android Developer. Whether you've never programmed before or are coming to mobile development for the first time, if you're truly inspired to learn Android Development, this is where you need to start.
         </p>
<p>
          This course has been in development for over two years, continuously perfected through research and testing in training bootcamps throughout the US. It represents a collaboration between a professional educator with over 20 years of experience in helping people learn and a professional mobile developer who has helped companies like Sony, Verizon, and nVidia build stunning mobile applications.
         </p>
<p>
          Starting with how the Java programming language works and progressing all the way to advanced Android concepts, you will get expertly produced instruction, visually descriptive explanations of deep concepts, screencasts that talk you through not just the “how” but also the “why,” and code challenges to test yourself and mark your progress.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Here’s what students are saying:
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          “Very clean and well done. Covers everything that you need to know for getting started whether you know how to code starting out or not. If you are at a loss trying to start making android apps this is the course for you.”
         </p>
<p>
          “I like this course, this would transform any normal person to a full fledged android developer.”
         </p>
<p>
          “This one is, by far, the most comprehensive, easy-to-follow, and genuinely well put together one of the bunch.”
         </p>
<p>
          “Inspirational! - got me over the hump (complete android beginner)”
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why it’s working...
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          One of the things we're most excited to offer with this course is access to the inner workings of the mind of a professional mobile developer. Throughout the course you will be able to listen in as our Learning Scientist teases apart all the thoughts that run through a professional mobile developer’s mind as he’s writing the code you will learn to create. It’s like sitting down in a movie with the writer, director, and lead actor. But in this case, it’s all in support of your transformation from novice to professional.
         </p>
<p>
          You will build several applications throughout the course, and the starting point for each project (as well as solutions to each challenge) will be available for download. You will also get all the visuals and info-graphics used throughout the course for reference and study.
         </p>
<p>
          ""Become An Android Developer From Scratch"" will give you a new, richer perspective on how mobile devices work. After you’ve completed this rigorous, challenging, and super fun course, you will be able to create your own apps, deploy to the Google Play store, and even interview for a job anywhere in the world.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           The real value...
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          The most important thing you will get from completing this course is the confidence to say “I’m an Android Developer!” You’ll be able to interact with other students and professionals in the Android community with pride and self-assuredness. You’ll also become an independent learner, able to discern where to go for information and how to continue advancing your skills.
         </p>
<p>
          No course is going to make you into an expert. It’s up to you to challenge yourself and find your path to making the apps you dream about. Become an Android Developer from Scratch is the best place to begin. Are you ready to get started?

<strong>
           The Problem
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Data scientist is one of the best suited professions to thrive this century. It is digital, programming-oriented, and analytical. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the demand for data scientists has been surging in the job marketplace.
         </p>
<p>
          However, supply has been very limited. It is difficult to acquire the skills necessary to be hired as a data scientist.
         </p>
<p>
          And how can you do that?
         </p>
<p>
          Universities have been slow at creating specialized data science programs. (not to mention that the ones that exist are very expensive and time consuming)
         </p>
<p>
          Most online courses focus on a specific topic and it is difficult to understand how the skill they teach fit in the complete picture
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           The Solution
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Data science is a multidisciplinary field. It encompasses a wide range of topics.
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            Understanding of the data science field and the type of analysis carried out
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Mathematics
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Statistics
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Python
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Applying advanced statistical techniques in Python
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Data Visualization
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Machine Learning
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Deep Learning
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
          Each of these topics builds on the previous ones. And you risk getting lost along the way if you don’t acquire these skills in the right order. For example, one would struggle in the application of Machine Learning techniques before understanding the underlying Mathematics. Or, it can be overwhelming to study regression analysis in Python before knowing what a regression is.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
            So, in an effort to create the most effective, time-efficient, and structured data science training available online, we created The Data Science Course 2023.
           </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
          We believe this is the first training program that solves the biggest challenge to entering the data science field
          <strong>
           – having all the necessary resources in one place.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Moreover, our focus is to teach topics that flow smoothly and complement each other. The course teaches you everything you need to know to become a data scientist at a fraction of the cost of traditional programs (not to mention the amount of time you will save).
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           The Skills
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           1.Intro to Data and Data Science
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Big data, business intelligence, business analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We know these buzzwords belong to the field of data science but what do they all mean?
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why learn it?
          </strong>
          As a candidate data scientist, you must understand the ins and outs of each of these areas and recognise the appropriate approach to solving a problem. This ‘Intro to data and data science’ will give you a comprehensive look at all these buzzwords and where they fit in the realm of data science.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           2. Mathematics
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Learning the tools is the first step to doing data science. You must first see the big picture to then examine the parts in detail.
         </p>
<p>
          We take a detailed look specifically at calculus and linear algebra as they are the subfields data science relies on.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why learn it?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Calculus and linear algebra are essential for programming in data science. If you want to understand advanced machine learning algorithms, then you need these skills in your arsenal.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           3. Statistics
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          You need to think like a scientist before you can become a scientist. Statistics trains your mind to frame problems as hypotheses and gives you techniques to test these hypotheses, just like a scientist.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why learn it?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          This course doesn’t just give you the tools you need but teaches you how to use them. Statistics trains you to think like a scientist.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           4. Python
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Python is a relatively new programming language and, unlike R, it is a general-purpose programming language. You can do anything with it! Web applications, computer games and data science are among many of its capabilities. That’s why, in a short space of time, it has managed to disrupt many disciplines. Extremely powerful libraries have been developed to enable data manipulation, transformation, and visualisation. Where Python really shines however, is when it deals with machine and deep learning.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why learn it?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          When it comes to developing, implementing, and deploying machine learning models through powerful frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc, Python is a must have programming language.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           5. Tableau
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Data scientists don’t just need to deal with data and solve data driven problems. They also need to convince company executives of the right decisions to make. These executives may not be well versed in data science, so the data scientist must but be able to present and visualise the data’s story in a way they will understand. That’s where Tableau comes in – and we will help you become an expert story teller using the leading visualisation software in business intelligence and data science.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why learn it?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          A data scientist relies on business intelligence tools like Tableau to communicate complex results to non-technical decision makers.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           6. Advanced Statistics
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Regressions, clustering, and factor analysis are all disciplines that were invented before machine learning. However, now these statistical methods are all performed through machine learning to provide predictions with unparalleled accuracy. This section will look at these techniques in detail.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why learn it?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Data science is all about predictive modelling and you can become an expert in these methods through this ‘advance statistics’ section.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           7. Machine Learning
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          The final part of the program and what every section has been leading up to is deep learning. Being able to employ machine and deep learning in their work is what often separates a data
          <em>
           scientist
          </em>
          from a data
          <em>
           analyst.
          </em>
          This section covers all common machine learning techniques and deep learning methods with TensorFlow.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why learn it?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Machine learning is everywhere. Companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have been using machines that can learn on their own for years. Now is the time for
          <em>
           you
          </em>
          to control the machines.
         </p>

          Welcome to the
          <em>
           Useful Excel for Beginners
          </em>
          course.
         </p>
<p>
          In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of Excel and become an effective user. The target audience for the course are those who have never used Excel before and those who are beginner level users. You would need a copy of Microsoft Excel for Windows since you will be practicing along with the course. I use Excel 2010 for Windows in the videos but any version with Excel 2007 for Windows or later would work. Excel Versions prior to 2007 have a different user interface but concepts will apply.
         </p>
<p>
          As the course is targeting beginners, it has been developed to be very easy to follow. We will be working with data related to a book store in the exercises. The files are available for download and you can follow along the videos while practicing.
         </p>
<p>
          The course covers the topics that you would need to know, to become a functional user. You can download the Table of Contents document from Chapter 1, to see all the topics the course will address. The course has 89 videos and runs for 9.5 hours.

          Welcome this comprehensive Ethical Hacking course! This course assumesyou have
          <strong>
           NOprior knowledge
          </strong>
          and by the end of it you'll be able to
          <strong>
           hack systems like black-hat hackers
          </strong>
          and
          <strong>
           secure them like security experts!
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Thiscourse ishighly
          <strong>
           practical
          </strong>
          but it won't neglect the theory; we'll start with ethical hacking basics, breakdown the different penetration testing fields and install the needed software (on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X), then we'll dive and start hacking straight away. You'll
          <strong>
           learn everything by example
          </strong>
          , by analysing and exploiting different systems such as networks, servers, clients, websites .....etc. We'll never have any boring dry theoretical lectures.
         </p>
<p>
          The course is divided into a number of sections, each section covers a penetration testing / hacking field, in each of these sections you'll first learn how the target system works, the weaknesses of this system, and how to
          <strong>
           practically
          </strong>
          exploit theses weaknesses to hack this system.
         </p>
<p>
          By the end of the course you will have a strong foundation in most hacking or penetration testing fields and you'll also learn how to
          <strong>
           detect, prevent and secure
          </strong>
          systems and yourself fromthe discussed attacks.
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
          The course is divided into four main sections:
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           1.Network Hacking
          </strong>
<em>
           -
          </em>
          This section will teach you how to test the security of both wired &amp; wireless networks. First, you will learn network basics, how they work, and how devices communicate with each other. Then it will branch into three sub sections:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            Pre-connection
            <strong>
</strong>
            attacks:
            <em>
</em>
            in this subsection you'll learn a number of attacks that can be executed without connecting to the target network and without the need to know the network password; you'll learn how to
            <strong>
             gatherinformation
            </strong>
            about the networks around you, discover connected devices, and control connections (
            <strong>
             deny/allow devices from connecting to networks
            </strong>
            ).
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Gaining Access: Now that you gathered information aboutthe networks around you, in this subsection you will learn how to
            <strong>
             crack
            </strong>
            the key and get the password to your target network whether it uses
            <strong>
             WEP, WPA
            </strong>
            or even
            <strong>
             WPA2
            </strong>
            .
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Post Connection attacks: Now that you have the key, you can connect to the target network, in this subsection you will learn a number of
            <strong>
             powerful techniques
            </strong>
            that allow you to gather comprehensive information about the connected devices,
            <strong>
             see anything they do on the internet
            </strong>
            (such as login information,
            <strong>
             passwords
            </strong>
            , visited urls, images, videos ....etc), redirect requests,
            <strong>
             inject evil code
            </strong>
            in loaded pages and much more! All of these attacks work against both wireless and wired networks. You will also learn how to
            <strong>
             create a fake WiFi network,
            </strong>
            attract users to connect to it and use all of the above techniques against the connected clients.
           </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
           2.Gaining Access
          </strong>
<em>
           -
          </em>
          In this section you will learn two main approaches to
          <strong>
           gain full control or hackcomputer systems
          </strong>
          :
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            Server Side Attacks
            <em>
             :
            </em>
            In this subsection you will learn how to
            <strong>
             gain full access
            </strong>
            to computer systems
            <strong>
             without user interaction
            </strong>
            . You will learn how to gather useful information about a target computer system such as itsoperating system,open ports, installed services, then use this information to
            <strong>
             discover weaknesses and vulnerabilities
            </strong>
            and
            <strong>
             exploit
            </strong>
            them to gain full control over the target. Finally you willlearn how to automatically scan servers for vulnerabilities and generate different types of
            <strong>
             reports
            </strong>
            with your discoveries.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Client Side Attacks
            <em>
             -
            </em>
            If the target system does not contain any weaknesses then the only way to hack it is by interacting with the users, in this subsection you'll learn how to get the target user to install a backdoor on their system without even realising, this is done by
            <strong>
             hijacking software updates
            </strong>
            or
            <strong>
             backdooring downloads
            </strong>
            on the fly. This subsection also teaches you how to use social engineering to hack secure systems, so you'll learn how to gather comprehensive information about system users such as their social accounts, friends, their mails.....etc, you'll learn how to
            <strong>
             create trojans
            </strong>
            by backdooring normal files (such as an image or a pdf) and use the gathered information to spoof emails so they appear as if they're sent from the target's friend, boss or any email account they're likely to interact with, to social engineer them into running your trojan.
           </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
           3.Post Exploitation
          </strong>
<em>
           -
          </em>
          In this section you will learn how to interact with the systems you compromised so far. You’lllearn how to
          <strong>
           access the file system
          </strong>
          (read/write/upload/execute),
          <strong>
           maintain your access
          </strong>
          ,
          <strong>
           spy
          </strong>
          on the target (capture key strikes, turn on the webcam, take screenshots....etc) and evenuse the target computer as a
          <strong>
           pivot
          </strong>
          to hack other systems.
          <br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           4.Website / Web Application Hacking
          </strong>
<em>
           -
          </em>
          In this section you will learn
          <strong>
           how websites work
          </strong>
          , how to
          <strong>
           gather information
          </strong>
          about a target website (such as website owner, server location, used technologies ....etc) and how to
          <strong>
           discover
          </strong>
          and
          <strong>
           exploit
          </strong>
          the following dangerous
          <strong>
           vulnerabilities
          </strong>
          to hack websites:
         </p>

<strong>
           What's the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          SQL is a language. Specifically, the ""Structured Query Language""
         </p>
<p>
          PostgreSQL is one of several database systems, or RDMS (Relational Database Management System). PostgresSQL is one of several RDMS's, others of which are Oracle, Informix, MySQL, and MSQL.
         </p>
<p>
          All of these RDMSs use SQL as their language. Each of them have minor variations in the ""dialect"" of SQL that they use, but it's all still SQL.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Which is better, PostgreSQL or MySQL?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Both are excellent products with unique strengths, and the choice is often a matter of personal preference.
         </p>
<p>
          PostgreSQL offers overall features for traditional database applications, while MySQL focuses on faster performance for Web-based applications.
         </p>
<p>
          Open source development will bring more features to subsequent releases of both databases.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Who uses these databases?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Here are a few examples of companies that use PostgreSQL: Apple, BioPharm, Etsy, IMDB, Macworld, Debian, Fujitsu, Red Hat, Sun Microsystem, Cisco, Skype.

         </p>
<p>
          This course is aimed at complete beginners who have never programmed before, as well as existing programmers who want to increase their career options by learning Python.
         </p>
<p>
          The fact is, Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world – Huge companies like Google use it in mission critical applications like Google Search.
         </p>
<p>
          And Python is the number one language choice for machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence. To get those high paying jobs you need an expert knowledge of Python, and that’s what you will get from this course.
         </p>
<p>
          By the end of the course you’ll be able to apply in confidence for Python programming jobs. And yes, this applies even if you have never programmed before. With the right skills which you will learn in this course, you can become employable and valuable in the eyes of future employers.
         </p>
<p>
          Here’s what a few students have told us about the course after going through it.
         </p>
<p>
          “I had very limited programming experience before I started this course, so I have really learned a lot from the first few sections. It has taken me from essentially zero programming skill to a level where I'm comfortable using Python to analyze data for my lab reports, and I'm not even halfway done the course yet. There are other courses out there which focus on data analysis, but those courses are usually targeted at people who already know how to program which is why I chose this course instead. “ – Christian DiMaria
          <br/>
<br/>
          “I have been puttering through your Python course . In that time, though, and without finishing it yet I've been able to automate quite a bit at my work. I work in a school system and unifying data from our various student information systems can be incredibly frustrating, time consuming, and at times challenging. Using your course, I've learned enough to write applications that turn massive text files into dictionaries that get ""stitched"" together like a database and output to properly formatted CSV files and then uploaded via SFTP to various systems for secure processing. Our teachers, students, and the tech department have greatly benefitted from this automation. I just wanted to drop you a note thanking you for helping me learn this skill.” – Keith Medlin
          <br/>
<br/>
          “This course was great. Within 3 weeks I was able to write my own database related applications.” – Theo Coenen
          <br/>
<br/>
          And there are many more students who love the course – check out all the reviews for yourself.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Will this course give you core python skills?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Yes it will. There are a range of exciting opportunities for Python developers. All of them require a solid understanding of Python, and that’s what you will learn in this course.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Will the course teach me data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          No, it won’t do that – All of these topics are branches of Python programming. And all of them require a solid understanding of the Python language.
         </p>
<p>
          Nearly all courses on these topics assume that you understand Python, and without it you will quickly become lost and confused.
         </p>
<p>
          This course will give you that core, solid understanding of the Python programming language.
         </p>
<p>
          By the end of the course you will be ready to apply for Python programming positions as well as move on to specific areas of Python, as listed above.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why should you take this course?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          There are a lot of Python courses on Udemy – Your instructors, Tim and Jean-Paul are pretty unique in that between them they have around 70 years of professional programming experience. That’s more than a lifetime of skills you get to learn Python from.
         </p>
<p>
          You can enrol in the course safe in the knowledge that they are not just teachers, but professional programmers with real commercial programming experience, having worked with big companies like IBM, Mitsubishi, Fujitsu and Saab in the past.
         </p>
<p>
          As such you will not only be learning Python, but you will be learning industry best practices for Python programming that real employers demand.
         </p>
<p>
          And if that’s not enough take a read of some of the many reviews from happy students – there are around 100,000 students who have left around 19,000 reviews.
         </p>
<p>
          This is one of the most popular courses on Python programming on Udemy.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Here’s just some of what you’ll learn
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          (It’s okay if you don’t understand all this yet, you will in the course)
         </p>
<p>
          · All the essential Python keywords, operators, statements, and expressions needed to fully understand exactly what you’re coding and why - making programming easy to grasp and less frustrating
         </p>
<p>
          · You will learn the answers to questions like What is the Python For Loop, what is Python used for, how Python switch the traditional syntax of code, and more.
         </p>
<p>
          · Complete chapters on object-oriented programming and many other aspects of Python, including tKInter (for building GUI Interfaces) and using databases with Python.
         </p>
<p>
          · Although this is primarily a Python 3 course, a python developer will need to work with Python 2 projects from time to time – We’ll show the difference in both versions to make sure you understand how things work differently in each version.
         </p>
<p>
          · How to develop powerful Python applications using one of the most powerful Integrated Development Environments on the market, IntelliJ IDEA! - Meaning you can code functional programs easier.
          <strong>
           IntelliJ
          </strong>
          has both a
          <strong>
           FREE
          </strong>
          andPAID version, and you can use either in this course. PyCharm will also work just fine.
         </p>
<p>
          (Don’t worry if you want to use another IDE. You’re free to use any IDE and still get the most out of this course).
          <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
           Does the course get updated?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          It’s no secret how technology is advancing at a rapid rate. New, more powerful hardware and software are being released
          <em>
           every day
          </em>
          , meaning it’s crucial to stay on top with the latest knowledge.
          <br/>
<br/>
          A lot of other courses on Udemy get released once, and never get updated. Learning from an outdated course and/or an outdated version of Python can be counter productive and even worse it could teach you the wrong way to do things.
         </p>
<p>
          For example if you apply some parts of Python 2 to Python 3 code, you will get completely different results.
         </p>
<p>
          We cover differences like this in the course and also continually update the course as well.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
            What if you have questions?
           </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
          As if this course wasn’t complete enough, we offer
          <strong>
           full support
          </strong>
          , answering any questions you have
          <strong>
           7 days a week
          </strong>
          (whereas many instructors answer just once per week,
          <em>
           or not at all
          </em>
          ).
         </p>
<p>
          This means you’ll never find yourself stuck on one lesson for days on end. With our hand-holding guidance, you’ll progress smoothly through this course without any major roadblocks.
         </p>
<p>
          That’s just one reason why Tim was voted
          <strong>
           top 10 in the Udemy instructor awards
          </strong>

<strong>
           Why Learn MySQL
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Consistently ranked the most in-demand skill in recent employer surveys, SQL is a fantastic way to increase your income and boost your professional development. So many companies today use MySQL, including Twitter, Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, Github, Kickstarter, Udemy, Slack, and many others.
          <strong>
           Unsure about the difference between SQL and MySQL?
          </strong>
          MySQL is the most popular open source SQL database out there, so it’s a great choice to begin your learning journey. We’ll talk a lot more about the difference between SQL and MySQL in the course, but 95% of what you learn about MySQL in this course will apply to other databases such as Postgres, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why This Course Is Different
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          This isn’t going to be a course where you watch me code for 20 hours; it’s a course with
          <strong>
           ample opportunity for you to get your hands dirty writing code
          </strong>
          (even within the first 7 minutes of the course).
         </p>
<p>
          My teaching experience is rooted in the classroom. I’ve spent years teaching programming, web development, and databases to my in-person bootcamp students. This course combines the best of my offline courses with the convenience of learning online, in a setting that’s best for you.
         </p>
<p>
          Upon completing this course, you’ll be able to interact with and query any SQL database out there. You’ll also be able to generate reports with ease, answer company performance questions using data, and integrate MySQL into complete applications.
         </p>
<p>

           So let’s do this! Enroll today and start learning SQL!

           fun and creative work, from anywhere in the world, and it even pays well
          </strong>
          . Web development is one of the
          <strong>
           most future-proof and highest-paying industries
          </strong>
          in the world. And HTML and CSS is the entry point to this world!
         </p>
<p>
          But you already know all this, that's why you want to learn HTML and CSS too. Well, you came to the right place!
         </p>
<p>
          This is the best and most complete course for starting your web development journey that you will find on Udemy. It's an
          <strong>
           all-in-one package
          </strong>
          that takes you from knowing nothing about HTML and CSS, to building beautiful websites using tools and technologies that professional web developers use every single day.
         </p>

</p>
<p>
<strong>
           [02] Why is this course so unique and popular?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
            Reason #1: The course is completely project-based
           </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
          Simple demos are boring, and therefore you're gonna learn everything by
          <strong>
           building actual projects
          </strong>
          ! In the final project (
          <em>
           www.omnifood.dev
          </em>
          ), together we hand-code a beautiful and responsive landing page for a
          <strong>
           fictional company
          </strong>
          that I made up just for the course.
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
            Reason #2: You will not just learn how to code
           </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
          Coding is great, but it's not everything! That's why we will go through the entire
          <strong>
           7-step process
          </strong>
          of building and launching our website project.
         </p>
<p>
          So the huge Omnifood project will teach you
          <strong>
           real-world skills to build real-world HTML and CSS websites
          </strong>
          : how to plan projects and page layouts, how to implement designs using HTML and CSS techniques, how to write clean and organized code, how to optimize websites for good speed performance, and many more.
         </p>
<p>
          On top of that, this course has a
          <strong>
           huge focus on beautiful design
          </strong>
          . In fact, this is the only course on the market that focuses on both coding and designing, together.
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
            Reason #3: I'm the right teacher for you
           </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
          With the right guidance and a well-structured curriculum, building websites can be
          <strong>
           quite easy and fun to learn
          </strong>
          . With a bunch of random tutorials and YouTube videos? Not so much. And that's where I come in.
         </p>
<p>
          My name is Jonas, I'm an experienced web developer and designer, and one of Udemy's top instructors. I have been teaching this bestselling course since 2015 to over 200,000 developers, always listening to feedback and understanding exactly how students actually learn.
         </p>
<p>
          Using that feedback, I recently rebuilt this course from scratch and
          <strong>
           designed the ideal course curriculum
          </strong>
          for every type of student. It's a
          <strong>
           unique blend
          </strong>
          of projects, deep explanations, theory lectures, and challenges. I'm sure you're gonna love it!
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           [03] Why is this course so long?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           Reason #1:
          </strong>
          I take time to
          <strong>
           explain every single concept
          </strong>
          that I teach, so that you actually learn, and not just copy code from the screen (
          <strong>
           this is a course
          </strong>
          , not a tutorial)
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Reason #2:
          </strong>
          I go into topics that other HTML and CSS courses shy away from: professional web design, component and layout patterns, some CSS theory, website planning in theory and practice, and developer skills. I believe you need all of this to be successful!
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Reason #3:
          </strong>
          There is a lot of repetition, so that you actually
          <strong>
           assimilate and practice
          </strong>
          what you learn. Practice is the single most important ingredient to learning, and therefore I provide plenty of opportunities for you to sharpen your skills
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           [04] Here is what's also included in the package:
          </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            Up-to-date HD-quality videos, that are easy to search and reference (great for Udemy Business students)
           </p>
</li>

<p>

           </p>

            Downloadable design assets + starter code and final code for each section
           </p>
</li>

<p>
            Downloadable slides for 20+ theory videos (not boring, I promise!)
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Access to countless free design and development resources that I curated over many years
           </p>

           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           [05] This course is for you if...
          </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            ... you are a complete beginner with no idea of how to build a website.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            ... you already know a bit of HTML and CSS from some tutorials or videos, but struggle to put together a good-looking, complete website.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            ... you are a designer and want to expand your skills into HTML and CSS, because all your designer friends are learning how to code (they are smart!).
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
          Basically, if you are an HTML and CSS master, and build the most beautiful websites in the world, then DON'T take the course. Everyone else: you should take the course, today.

<strong>
           Begin Your Game Programming Journey the Proven Way
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          ""Make the simplest game possible."" ""Program a ball and paddle project."" ""Practice by first remaking something from the 1970's."" All beginning developers hear this advice from more experienced peers... because it works!
         </p>
<p>
          By following this approach you will:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Learn design from a fun classic that people know and enjoy.
          </li>
<li>
           Start your practice today – now! – without waiting for an idea.
          </li>
<li>
           Finish your game in hours or in a weekend, not over months.
          </li>
<li>
           Understand every line of code used in the entire program.
          </li>
<li>
           Avoid distraction from searching for or creating detailed art.
          </li>
<li>
           Master fundamentals needed to make your own games better.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          You can program this game with a normal text editor, and run it in the web browser you already have. No special software is needed.
         </p>
<p>
          Though you'll be coding in JavaScript for HTML5 canvas in this course, the focus is on common game programming concepts. You can later apply these same patterns to get quick results in other programming languages such as C#, Java, ActionScript 3, C++, or Python.
         </p>
<p>
          I'm a private game development trainer, and for clients new to gameplay programming this is exactly the material that I cover to get them started quickly. Within hours you will have finished programming your first project. This is the fastest way to get results. The momentum gained from doing this provides a solid foundation to give more advanced concepts meaning and context as you continue on in your journey of learning game development.

          of students who want to start their Machine learning journey-
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           What is Machine Learning?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Machine Learning is a field of computer science which gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why use Python for Machine Learning?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.
         </p>
<p>
          Though it hasn’t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here’s a brief history:
         </p>
<p>
          In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.
         </p>
<p>
          In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets’s annual poll of data scientists’ most used tools.
         </p>
<p>
          In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.
         </p>
<p>
          Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it’s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why use R for Machine Learning?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R
         </p>
<p>
          1. It’s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it’s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.
         </p>
<p>
          2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind.
         </p>
<p>
          3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science.
         </p>
<p>
          4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it’s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.
         </p>
<p>
          5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier – and of course, it’ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you’re looking for jobs in data science.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge—and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.
         </p>
<p>
          Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.

          Artificial intelligence is growing exponentially. There is no doubt about that. Self-driving cars are clocking up millions of miles, IBM Watson is diagnosing patients better than armies of doctors and Google Deepmind's AlphaGo beat the World champion at Go - a game where intuition plays a key role.
         </p>
<p>
          But the further AI advances, the more complex become the problems it needs to solve. And only Deep Learning can solve such complex problems and that's why it's at the heart of Artificial intelligence.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           --- Why DeepLearning A-Z? ---
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Here are five reasons we think Deep Learning A-Z™really is different, and stands out from the crowd ofother training programs out there:
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           1. ROBUST STRUCTURE
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          The first and most important thing we focused on is giving the course a robust structure. Deep Learning is very broad and complex and to navigate this maze you need a clear and global vision of it.
         </p>
<p>
          That's why we grouped the tutorials into two volumes, representing the two fundamental branches of Deep Learning: Supervised Deep Learning and Unsupervised Deep Learning.With each volume focusing on three distinct algorithms, we found that this is the best structure for mastering Deep Learning.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           2. INTUITION TUTORIALS
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          So many courses and books just bombard you with the theory, and math, and coding... But they forget to explain, perhaps, the most important part:
          <strong>
           why you are doing what you are doing.
          </strong>
          And that's how this course is so different. We focus on developing an intuitive
          <em>
           *feel*
          </em>
          for the concepts behind Deep Learning algorithms.
         </p>
<p>
          With our intuition tutorials you will be confident that you understand all the techniques on an instinctive level. And once you proceed to the hands-on coding exercises you will see for yourself how much more meaningful your experience will be.This is a game-changer.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           3. EXCITING PROJECTS
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Are you tired of courses based on over-used, outdated data sets?
         </p>
<p>
          Yes? Well then you're in for a treat.
         </p>
<p>
          Inside this class we will work on Real-World datasets, to solve Real-World business problems. (Definitely not the boring iris or digit classification datasets that we see in every course). In this course we will solve six real-world challenges:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Artificial Neural Networks to solve a Customer Churn problem
          </li>
<li>
           Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Recognition
          </li>
<li>
           RecurrentNeural Networks to predict Stock Prices
          </li>
<li>
           Self-Organizing Maps to investigate Fraud
          </li>
<li>
           Boltzmann Machines to create a Recomender System
          </li>
<li>
           Stacked Autoencoders* to take on the challenge for the
           <strong>
            Netflix $1 Million prize
           </strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>
           *Stacked Autoencoders is a brand new technique in Deep Learning which didn't even exist a couple of years ago. We haven't seen this method explained anywhere else in sufficient depth.
          </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           4. HANDS-ON CODING
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          InDeep Learning A-Z™ we code together with you.Every practical tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means.
         </p>
<p>
          In addition, we will purposefully structure the code in such a way so that you can download it and apply it in your own projects.Moreover, we explain step-by-step where and how to modify the code to insert YOUR dataset, to tailor the algorithm to your needs, to get the output that you are after.
         </p>
<p>
          This is a course which naturally extends into your career.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           5. IN-COURSE SUPPORT
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Have you ever taken a course or read a book where you have questions but cannot reach the author?
         </p>
<p>
          Well, this course is different. We are fully committed to making this the most disruptive and powerful Deep Learning course on the planet. With that comes a responsibility to constantly be there when you need our help.
         </p>
<p>
          In fact, since we physically also need to eat and sleep we have put together a team of professional Data Scientists to help us out. Whenever you ask a question you will get a response from us within 48 hours maximum.
         </p>
<p>
          No matter how complex your query, we will be there.The bottom line is we want you to succeed.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           ---The Tools---
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Tensorflow and Pytorch are the two most popular open-source libraries for Deep Learning. In this course you will learn both!
         </p>
<p>
          TensorFlow was developed by Google and is used in their speech recognition system, in the new google photos product, gmail, google search and much more. Companies using Tensorflow include AirBnb, Airbus, Ebay, Intel, Uber and dozens more.
         </p>
<p>
          PyTorch is as just as powerful and is being developed by researchers at Nvidia and leading universities: Stanford, Oxford, ParisTech. Companies using PyTorch include Twitter, Saleforce and Facebook.
         </p>
<p>
          So which is better and for what?
         </p>
<p>
          Well, in this course you will have an opportunity to work with both and understand when Tensorflow is better and when PyTorch is the way to go. Throughout the tutorials we compare the two and give you tips and ideas on which could work best in certain circumstances.
         </p>
<p>
          The interesting thing is that both these libraries are barely over 1 year old. That's what we mean when we say that in this course we teach you the most cutting edge Deep Learning models and techniques.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           --- MoreTools---
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
           Theano
          </em>
          is another open source deep learning library. It's very similar to Tensorflow in its functionality, but nevertheless we will still cover it.
         </p>
<p>
<em>
           Keras
          </em>
          is an incredible library to implement Deep Learning models. It acts as a wrapper for Theano and Tensorflow. Thanks to Keras we can create powerful and complex Deep Learning models with only a few lines of code. This is what will allow you to have a global vision of what you are creating. Everything you make will look so clear and structured thanks to this library, that you will really get the intuition and understanding of what you are doing.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           --- Even MoreTools---
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
           Scikit-learn
          </em>
          the most practical Machine Learning library. We will mainly use it:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           to evaluate the performance of our models with the most relevant technique, k-Fold Cross Validation
          </li>
<li>
           to improve our models with effective Parameter Tuning
          </li>
<li>
           to preprocess our data, so that our models can learn in the best conditions
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          And of course, we have to mention the usual suspects. This whole course is based on Python and in every single section you will be getting hours and hours of invaluable hands-on practical coding experience.
         </p>
<p>
          Plus, throughout the course we will be usingNumpy to do high computations and manipulate high dimensional arrays,Matplotlib to plot insightful charts andPandas to import and manipulate datasets the most efficiently.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           --- Who Is This Course For?---
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          As you can see, there are lots of different tools in the space of Deep Learning and in this course we make sure to show you the most important and most progressive ones so that when you're done with Deep Learning A-Z™ your skills are on the cutting edge of today's technology.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           If you are just starting out into Deep Learning,
          </strong>
          then you will find this course extremely useful. Deep Learning A-Z™ is structured around special coding blueprint approaches meaning that you won't get bogged down in unnecessary programming or mathematical complexities and instead you will be applying Deep Learning techniques from very early on in the course.You will build your knowledge from the ground up and you will see how with every tutorial you are getting more and more confident.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           If you already have experience with Deep Learning,
          </strong>
          you will find this course refreshing, inspiring and very practical. Inside Deep Learning A-Z™ you will master some of the most cutting-edge Deep Learning algorithms and techniques (some of which didn't even exist a year ago) and through this course you will gain an immense amount of valuable hands-on experience with real-world business challenges. Plus, inside you will find inspiration to explore new Deep Learning skills and applications.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           ---Real-World Case Studies ---
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Mastering Deep Learning is not just about knowing the intuition and tools, it's also about being able to apply these models to real-world scenarios and derive actual measurable results for the business or project. That's why in this course we are introducing six exciting challenges:
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           #1 Churn Modelling Problem
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          In this part you will be solving a data analytics challenge for a bank. You will be given a dataset with a large sample of the bank's customers. To make this dataset, the bank gathered information such as customer id, credit score, gender, age, tenure, balance, if the customer is active, has a credit card, etc. During a period of 6 months, the bank observed if these customers left or stayed in the bank.
         </p>
<p>
          Your goal is to make an Artificial Neural Network that can predict, based on geo-demographical and transactional information given above, if any individual customer will leave the bank or stay (customer churn). Besides, you are asked to rank all the customers of the bank, based on their probability of leaving. To do that, you will need to use the right Deep Learning model, one that is based on a probabilistic approach.
         </p>
<p>
          If you succeed in this project, you will create significant added value to the bank. By applying your Deep Learning model the bank may significantly reduce customer churn.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           #2 Image Recognition
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          In this part, you will create a Convolutional Neural Network that is able to detect various objects in images. We will implement this Deep Learning model to recognize a cat or a dog in a set of pictures. However, this model can be reused to detect anything else and we will show you how to do it - by simply changing the pictures in the input folder.
         </p>
<p>
          For example, you will be able to train the same model on a set of brain images, to detect if they contain a tumor or not. But if you want to keep it fitted to cats and dogs, then you will literally be able to a take a picture of your cat or your dog, and your model will predict which pet you have. We even tested it out on Hadelin’s dog!
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           #3Stock Price Prediction
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          In this part, you will create one of the most powerful Deep Learning models. We will even go as far as saying that you will create the Deep Learning model closest to
          <em>
           “Artificial Intelligence”
          </em>
          . Why is that? Because this model will have long-term memory, just like us, humans.
         </p>
<p>
          The branch of Deep Learning which facilitates this is Recurrent Neural Networks. Classic RNNs have short memory, and were neither popular nor powerful for this exact reason. But a recent major improvement in Recurrent Neural Networks gave rise to the popularity of LSTMs (Long Short Term Memory RNNs) which has completely changed the playing field.We are extremely excited to include these cutting-edge deep learning methods in our course!
         </p>
<p>
          In this part you will learn how to implement this ultra-powerful model, and we will take the challenge to use it to predict the real Google stock price. A similar challenge has already been faced by researchers at Stanford University and we will aim to do at least as good as them.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           #4Fraud Detection
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          According to a recent report published by Markets &amp; Markets the Fraud Detection and Prevention Market is going to be worth $33.19 Billion USD by 2021. This is a huge industry and the demand for advanced Deep Learning skills is only going to grow. That’s why we have included this case study in the course.
         </p>
<p>
          This is the first part of Volume 2 - Unsupervised Deep Learning Models. The business challenge here is about detecting fraud in credit card applications. You will be creating a Deep Learning model for a bank and you are given a dataset that contains information on customers applying for an advanced credit card.

          This is the data that customers provided when filling the application form. Your task is to detect potential fraud within these applications. That means that by the end of the challenge, you will literally come up with an explicit list of customers who potentially cheated on their applications.

           #5 &amp; 6 Recommender Systems
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          From Amazon product suggestions to Netflix movie recommendations - good recommender systems are very valuable in today's World. And specialists who can create them are some of the top-paid Data Scientists on the planet.
         </p>
<p>
          We will work on a dataset that has exactly the same features as the Netflix dataset: plenty of movies, thousands of users, who have rated the movies they watched. The ratings go from 1 to 5, exactly like in the Netflix dataset, which makes the Recommender System more complex to build than if the ratings were simply “Liked” or “Not Liked”.
         </p>
<p>
          Your final Recommender System will be able to predict the ratings of the movies the customers didn’t watch. Accordingly, by ranking the predictions from 5 down to 1, your Deep Learning model will be able to recommend which movies each user should watch. Creating such a powerful Recommender System is quite a challenge so we will give ourselves two shots. Meaning we will build it with two different Deep Learning models.
         </p>
<p>
          Our first model will be Deep Belief Networks, complex Boltzmann Machines that will be covered in Part 5. Then our second model will be with the powerful AutoEncoders, my personal favorites. You will appreciate the contrast between their simplicity, and what they are capable of.
         </p>
<p>
          And you will even be able to apply it to yourself or your friends. The list of movies will be explicit so you will simply need to rate the movies you already watched, input your ratings in the dataset, execute your model and voila! The Recommender System will tell you exactly which movies you would love one night you if are out of ideas of what to watch on Netflix!

Love all the extras the course provides especially the assets(graphics, sound files, etc) for practice projects as I'm always taking too much time to find some assets to play with. This course understands how to teach programmers by giving them the toolsets and abilities they need to build apps. The course teaches the foundation of the language as well as skills to build your knowledge and improve your troubleshooting skills.

             Data analyst:
            </strong>
            This is a very interesting opportunity. It is especially for those who like working with huge amounts of data and finding meaning in that data. This is again a very popular job role. There are many companies that are looking for people who can work with the large sets of data that they have access to. These companies are looking for people skilled in Python because Pandas, SciPy, and other Python libraries come in very handy in accomplishing this task. No wonder more and more companies are looking for data analysts with experience in python to fill open positions.

<strong>
             Product manager:
            </strong>
            Product managers have a very important role to play when it comes to helping businesses to understand the market and why building one product will be better than building another. They study the market, research for new features related to a particular product or category and advocate the building of certain products with facts. Data is a very important part of the work they do. This is why most companies today are looking for product managers that are skilled in python.

<strong>
             Machine learning engineer:
            </strong>
            If you don’t already know, then let us tell you that the job postings for this position have increased by more than 330% in the last couple of years. If you are skilled in python, you will be given preference over other candidates.

Python’s ability to work with data automation and algorithms makes it the ideal programming language that can be used in machine learning.

<p>
<strong>
           Our Approach:
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          My teaching method can be summed up in three bullets:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Heavily Science Based
          </li>
<li>
           Entertainment + Education = Edutainment (I love to make up words)
          </li>
<li>
           Tactical and Actionable
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
          I take a science based approach to influence. These aren't tricks or gimmicks. They are steps based on years of research out of academic institutions and peer-reviewed journals.
         </p>
<p>
          Although I have a lot of science, I have a cheeky sense of humor. So I promise, the course will surprise and entertain you.
         </p>
<p>
          I kept this course concise, compact and actionable because you're busy and you want change NOW! I got you.

          HTML5 is one of the hot web technologies and is widely gaining acceptance across mobile and web. In our course, you get a complete resource that can get you started on application development for HTML5. In our course, you work on actual examples and go through important concepts required for thorough knowledge.
         </p>
<p>
          In our course, you will start with basic HTML tags. You will learn how to create HTML websites and use CSS in your work before we start discussing HTML5. We do not assume any prior knowledge so we go through the concepts from the beginner's point of view. In our HTML5 lectures, we start with new tags and forms. We then gradually move to advance topics like Drag and Drop and Multimedia. We follow it with difficult topics like Geolocation, WebStorage, and Application cache. This course creates easy to grasp examples for each of the concepts and by the end of it, you will be able to understand the complete picture rather than just bits and pieces of the technology. Some of the salient features for the course are:

           What Is Spring Boot?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Spring Boot is the modern development approach for building enterprise application. Spring Boot minimizes the configuration required for setting up Spring projects. By using Spring Boot, you can accelerate your development speed and leverage the auto-configuration features. This course covers the latest version of Spring Boot 3.
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           What Is Spring?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Spring is an enterprise Java framework. It was designed to simplify Jakarta EE development and make developers more productive. Spring makes use of Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection to promote good software coding practices and speed up development time. This course covers the latest version of Spring 6.
         </p>
<p>
          This course covers Spring Core, Annotations, All Java Spring Configuration, Spring AOP, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring REST, Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA.
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           What Is Hibernate/JPA?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Hibernate/JPA is an Object-to-Relational-Mapping (ORM) framework. It simplifies database access for Java applications. By using the framework, you can easily store and retrieve Java objects by setting up some simple configuration mappings.
         </p>
<p>
          This course covers basic Hibernate/JPA CRUD. Also, advanced Hibernate/JPA mappings are covered for one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many.
         </p>

Learn full-stack JavaScript development with over 24 hours of HD video tutorials covering ReactJS, NodeJS, LoopbackJS, Redux, Material-UI and socket programming! This course was designed to provide students with hands-on coding experience. We will begin by programming a calculator using React, and finish the course by coding an advanced chat application using WebSockets. A working knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript will be helpful when taking this course.

<p>
<strong>
           3 Coding Projects in the course:
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          • Calculator Application - We will go over the basics of what React is, how to create components and how to work within the React life-cycle.
         </p>
<p>
          • Weblog - We will build a feature rich blog app using React and LoopbackJS. We will begin to explore the full-stack elements of JavaScript by coding our own REST API, and see how the front and back-end can communicate with each other.
         </p>
<p>
          • Chat Application - We will explore socket programming. With a WebSocket you can keep clients connected on the server side. We will program a chat app where you can create a user account, add other users and then message back and forth with them.

           QUESTION: What If You Could Get Twice As Much Done Tomorrow As You HaveAny Day This Year?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Six years ago, I was sitting in the passenger seat of acar with my friend.
         </p>
<p>
          My friend turns to me and says""It's incredible how much I've gotten done in thisyear! So much has changed.""
         </p>
<p>
          And all Icould do is smile. Becausefor me, almostnothinghad changed.
         </p>
<p>
          The truth is that we all want to use your time well. But in order to do so, you need to know certain principles you'll never learn in school.
         </p>
<p>
          I didn't want to face another year where nothing changed. That's why I went after the answers. And it's also why I made this course.
         </p>
<p>
          Inside, I'm going to share with you 7 specific steps you can take today to become more productive, taken from my course How To Double Your Productivity By Tomorrow Morning. If you take these ideas and apply them, I think you'll become more productive than you ever have before.

           Understand basics of SEO

</ul>
<br/>
<p>
          SEO is the active practice of optimizing a web site by improving internal and external aspects in order to increase the traffic the site receives from search engines. Firms that practice SEO can vary; some have a highly specialized focus, while others take a more broad and general approach. Optimizing a web site for search engines can require looking at so many unique elements that many practitioners of SEO (SEOs) consider themselves to be in the broad field of website optimization (since so many of those elements intertwine).

          Hello everyone and welcome to Adobe Photoshop 2022 Ultimate Guide.
         </p>
<p>
          In this video, I'm going to go over an in-depth overview of what we're going to be learning throughout the course.
         </p>
<p>
          So in Section two, we're going to talk about Adobe Creative Cloud plans and pricing.
         </p>
<p>
          So we'll cover individuals, business students and teachers and schools, universities.
         </p>
<p>
          Next will learn how to create a free creative cloud account.
         </p>
<p>
          Then from there, we'll work with Adobe Creative Cloud Web and learn step by step how to install Adobe Photoshop 2022.
         </p>
<p>
          Once we've done that, then we'll go over the welcome page interface.
         </p>
<p>
          So we'll cover new file, Open Home, Learn your files shared with you.
         </p>
<p>
          Lightroom Photos Deleted Cloud Search What's new in Photoshop?
         </p>
<p>
          And then we'll talk about also how to get access to our creative cloud account right from inside Photoshop.
         </p>
<p>
          Then from there, we're going to open up a basic project and we're going to cover the main menu.
         </p>
<p>
          So file edit image layer type, select filter, 3D view, plugins, window and help.
         </p>
<p>
          And then we'll cover workspaces, which you can see right here.
         </p>
<p>
          And then we'll cover all the panels here and what they do.
         </p>
<p>
          And then we'll talk about preferences.
         </p>
<p>
          So you can see all the preferences that we have right here.
         </p>
<p>
          And the reason for the basic project is to give you a clear understanding of what the main menu does.
         </p>
<p>
          What are all the options in the main menu?
         </p>
<p>
          What are the options for workspaces?
         </p>
<p>
          What are the options for panels?
         </p>
<p>
          What are the options for preferences?
         </p>
<p>
          And then we'll talk about the tools.
         </p>
<p>
          So we'll cover all the tools here while we build out this project.
         </p>
<p>
          Okay.
         </p>
<p>
          To give you an introduction to Photoshop, then we're going to go to the next level.
         </p>
<p>
          We're going to level up and we're going to do 30 really good projects.
         </p>
<p>
          And you can see right here we have I'll go to my files and I'll go to Photoshop.
         </p>
<p>
          We're going to save this on the cloud and we're going to build out Learn Tech Plus, I'm going to do 30 projects.
         </p>
<p>
          Okay.
         </p>
<p>
          So we're going to build each one of these step by step from scratch.
         </p>
<p>
          And you're going to learn a lot of the fundamentals that you need to know about Photoshop.
         </p>
<p>
          Okay.
         </p>
<p>
          It's going to be a ton of fun.
         </p>

<p>
          Thousands of other engineers have learned React and Redux, and you can too. This course uses a
          <strong>
           time-tested, battle-proven
          </strong>
          method to make sure you understand exactly how React and Redux work, and will get you a new job working as a software engineer or help you build that app you've always been dreaming about.

          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          React is the most popular Javascript library of the last five years, and the job market is still hotter than ever.

<p>
          Bem-vindo ou bem-vinda, é um prazer te receber no curso de Android!
         </p>
<p>
          Este curso foi preparado para te ensinar sobre o desenvolvimento de aplicações Android, quer você conheça ou não sobre programação. A estrutura do curso foi pensada para te levar desde os conceitos mais básicos e teóricos até conceitos mais avançados junto com mão na massa.

</p>
<p>
<strong>
           Como está estruturado? Quais os tópicos que vou aprender?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          O curso começa com Introdução à computação e introdução à lógica de programação para pessoas que não possuam experiência em programação. Posteriormente é feita a instalação do Java e da IDE IntelliJ (ambiente de desenvolvimento) nos três sistemas operacionais mais usados atualmente, Windows, Linux e Mac.
         </p>
<p>
          Uma vez instalado os softwares, você tem o que precisa para aprender sobre Java que será a linguagem usada no desenvolvimento das aplicações. Os assuntos tratados englobam variaveis, tipos de dados, operações matemáticas, tipos primitivos e funções.
         </p>
<p>
          Posteriormente é feita a instalação do Android Studio e começamos com a prática de desenvolvimento de aplicações. As aplicações Android serão criadas do zero sem cópia de código para que seja possível entender toda a teoria para o desenvolvimento. Será feito a manipulação dos elementos de interface, customização e criação da lógica das aplicações.
         </p>
<p>
          Alguns dos assuntos cobertos:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            Variáveis e tipos de dados, funções e exceções em Java
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Estrutura de uma aplicação Android
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Activity e ciclo de vida
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            LinearLayout
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Alteração do ícone da aplicação
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            SharedPreferences e navegação entre Activities
           </p>
<p>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
          Para as aplicações, usaremos
          <strong>
           Android Studio 3.4
          </strong>
          e versões mais recentes do Android!
         </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           Quais os próximos passos?
          </strong>

          In thisSEO tutorial for beginners, you'll learn about the
          <strong>
<em>
            Three Pillars of Powerful SEO:
           </em>
</strong>
<br/>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Keyword Research:
            </strong>
            How to find keywords that attract visitors who want to buy

            How to build authority on your site using links so Google knows you have the best content for it's users.
           </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
          Getting to the top of the search results is the goal of search engine optimization because the higher you appear in the search results, the more free traffic you'll get which means more sales and more money in your pocket!
         </p>
<p>
          Because my goal is to get you up to speed as quickly as possible, I've been careful to make the course lectures snappy, efficient, and always delivered in plain English. Throughout the course, I've also included lots of examples to help you retain the key concepts and strategies we discuss.
         </p>
<p>
          This SEO Tutorial for beginners is a valuable investment to make in yourself because SEO is a skill you can use for your own online ventures
          <strong>
           AND ALSO

          bring to the table to help friends, colleagues, and other business partners.
         </p>
<p>
          And the Bottom line is if you don't understand SEO and apply it to your business online, you're MISSING OUT on Massive amounts of
          <em>
           free traffic
          </em>
          from the search engines

<p>
<strong>
           A Course to Learn Both the Theory and Real-World Skills
           <br/>
</strong>
          This is the only course you need to learn both the theoretical and practical aspects of Python. It is ideal for people who do not have a programming background. By the end of the course, you will have a portfolio of Python apps on your GitHub account. You will learn Python by building 20 apps together with the instructor and solve 10 independent Python projects. This will help you code independently and apply for a junior developer job after finishing the course.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Multimodal Learning
           <br/>
</strong>
          The course follows a proven multimodal learning approach that offers students a video course and an environment that simulates real-world programming activities similar to an on-site bootcamp. Students learn Python by building programs from scratch, adding new features to existing programs, improving existing features, fixing bugs, engaging in code experiments, learning programming tools that every programmer should know, deploying apps in the cloud, and interacting with other fellow students. Your skill set will progressively and strongly build up as you build your programming portfolio to list and showcase all your Python projects.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           A Course for Absolute Beginners
           <br/>
</strong>
          This course is perfect for those who have never programmed before. It covers every Python concept using real-world examples, making it easy to understand both the Python language and the logic behind programming. From the basics to the advanced features like threading, everything is introduced in the context of a real-world application that you will build. This approach will make abstract programming concepts easy to grasp.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Instructor-Led and Independent Student Projects
           <br/>
</strong>
          In this course, you will build programs daily to develop your skills. Each day, you will work on projects led by your instructor and then work on projects independently to solidify your skills. At the end of the day, you can compare your code with the instructor's code to identify and address any gaps in your understanding.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Career Change or App Development
           <br/>
</strong>
          If you're considering a career change to become a Python programmer or looking to turn your idea into a real app, this course is perfect for you. You can take the full course to become a programmer or pick specific projects that interest you if you only want to build a particular app. Additionally, you will learn Git and GitHub so that you can create a portfolio of 20 Python apps on your GitHub account, which you can show to potential employers or share with friends.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           From Data Science to Web Development
           <br/>
</strong>
          This course covers a wide range of applications, from creating rich data science web apps that analyze and visualize large amounts of data to building web applications using Python web frameworks such as Streamlit, Flask, and Django. It also covers other aspects of Python, such as automating tedious tasks, ranging from generating PDF invoices to automating emails. In short, this course offers a comprehensive approach to Python, covering various domains, making it an all-in-one solution.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Flexible Learning Schedule
          </strong>
<br/>
          This curriculum is designed to accommodate your schedule. While it is recommended that you study 2-5 hours every day, you can also work through multiple-day modules during the weekend or whenever it is convenient for you. You will also have unlimited access to all the videos and practice activities. By committing to this course, you will be able to achieve better results than a 10,000-dollar boot camp.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Boosted Focus
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Keeping yourself focused and motivated with online courses is hard, but not with this course. The course is designed around real-world projects and challenges to keep students interested throughout the entire course. This is a course that you will actually finish.

           - ""If you don’t know where to start I suggest you start here.
          </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
           The course provides a hands-on approach to learning and applying the basics from the start. A large number of libraries and tools are introduced in an organised way. The teacher is knowledgeable and engaging.
          </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
           Python offers so many possibilities, but Ardit has managed to pull a good selection together that allows you to gain an insight into what you can do.
          </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
           I enjoyed the broad spectrum of the many topics: Streamlit webapps, basic data plotting, graphical user interfaces, create pdfs, data analysis with pandas, web scraping, Jupyter, API keys, sql and more. Always using them, building something, not just theory.
          </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
           And you don’t just learn the syntax, you learn how to set up your working environment, how to approach and plan an application, how to troubleshoot and debug, how to improve your code, where and how to find answers to solve problems.
          </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
           The only thing that frustrated me somewhat, was that the concept and implementation of Object Orientated Programming could possibly have been introduced earlier in the course. Understanding just the very basics greatly improves your overall insight, which in turn, aides your learning.
          </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
           Although I would not say that finishing this course makes for job-ready developer, I do feel it gives you a solid foundation and it prepares you well for a deeper dive into your chosen, or even newly discovered, field of interest.
          </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
           All in all, it shows that a great deal of effort has been put in the creation of this course. It is currently even further expanded and I’m looking forward to even more content. A big thank you to Ardit for putting together such a great course.""

<p>
<em>
           Course is set for 60 ""days"". I would say each day takes 3-4 hours. Entire course took me about 2 months. Course starts with Python basics and then you build several apps which highlight the major uses of Python, including command line apps, GUI apps, web applications, and databases. I would suggest you print out the code and keep as a reference for yor future projects. Also, follow along by trying all the code yourself and the student projects so you relly learn. Looking forward to another course with Ardit!""

<p>
          Have you tried to learn Node before? You start a new course, and the instructor has you installing a bunch of libraries before you even know what Node is or how it works. You eventually get stuck and reach out to the instructor, but you get no reply. You then close the course and never open it again.
         </p>
<p>
          Sound familiar?
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           I created this course to be what I wanted when I was learning Node.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          The Complete Node.js Developer Course covers the fundamentals of Node before diving deep into great tools like Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB.
         </p>
<p>
          The entire course is based around a single goal: Turning you into a professional Node developer capable of developing, testing, and deploying real-world production applications.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           The best way to learn Node is by building Node apps.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          From the very start you’ll be programming every project and working through challenges that I’ve designed to reinforce what you’ve learned. This will give you the hands-on experience necessary to be able to create and launch your own project once you’re done.
         </p>
<p>
          You’ll be building four projects:
         </p>
<p>
          1. A note-taking app to get your feet wet
         </p>
<p>
          2. A weather application that interacts with the MapBox and Dark Sky APIs
         </p>
<p>
          3. A task manager REST API complete with user accounts and authentication
         </p>
<p>
          4. A real-time chat app with a client-side companion
         </p>
<p>
          By the end, you’ll be able to take what you’ve learned and launch your own Node application.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           When learning, learn the latest.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          I work to keep this course full of the most up-to-date Node material out there. This course is compatible with the latest Node.js version.
         </p>
<p>
          You’re getting access to hot-off-the-press features.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Everything you need comes in one easy-to-use package.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          You can stop worrying if you're learning the right skills to build an app or land a new job. I've curated all the tech that's essential to building real-world apps. I've mapped out everything in a comprehensive, easy-to-follow package designed to get you up and running in a few weeks.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           There’s no better time to learn Node.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          According to the 2016 Stack Overflow Survey, Node is in the top ten for back-end popularity and back-end salary, with an average salary of $85k. This means more jobs and more opportunities for you.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           You might get stuck. But I’m here to help.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          There’s nothing worse than getting five hours into a course, getting stuck, and not getting the help you need to continue.
         </p>
<p>
          I’m in the Q&amp;A everyday to help you get unstuck. I reply to every question to get you back on track.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Don’t take my word for it. Check the reviews and see what other students are saying.
          </strong>

<strong>
           Why learn a JavaScript course?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          The most obvious reason for learning JavaScript is if you have hopes of becoming a web developer. Even if you haven’t got your heart set on a tech career, being proficient in JavaScript will enable you to build websites from scratch—a pretty useful skill to have in today’s job market!
          <br/>
<br/>
          1)
          <strong>
           JavaScript experts are versatile -
          </strong>
          JavaScript is an extremely versatile language. Once you’ve mastered JavaScript, the possibilities are endless: you can code on the client-side (frontend) using Angular and on the server-side (backend) using Node.js. You can also develop web, mobile, and desktop apps using React, React Native, and Electron, and you can even get involved in machine learning.
         </p>
<p>
          2)
          <strong>
           JavaScript experts are in-demand (and well-paid) -
          </strong>
          JavaScript is the most popular programming language in the world, so it’s no wonder that JavaScript is one of the most sought-after skills in the web development industry today. The global demand for JavaScript seems to outweigh the expertise available on the market. According to this HackerRank report, 48% of employers worldwide need developers with JavaScript skills, while only 42% of student developers claim to be proficient in JavaScript.
         </p>
<p>
          3)
          <strong>
           JavaScript is beginner-friendly -
          </strong>
          Compared to many other programming languages, JavaScript offers one of the more beginner-friendly entry points into the world of coding. The great thing about JavaScript is that it comes installed on every modern web browser—there’s no need to set up any kind of development environment, which means you can start coding with JavaScript right away!
          <br/>
<br/>
          Another advantage of learning
          <strong>
           JavaScript
          </strong>
          as your first programming language is that you get instant feedback; with a minimal amount of JavaScript code, you’ll immediately see visible results. There’s also a huge JavaScript community on sites like Stack Overflow, so you’ll find plenty of support as you learn. Not only is JavaScript beginner-friendly; it will also set you up with some extremely valuable transferable skills. JavaScript supports object-oriented, functional, and imperative styles of programming—
          <strong>
           skills that can be transferred to any new language you might learn later on, such as Python, Java, or C++.
          </strong>
<strong>
           JavaScript
          </strong>
          provides a crucial introduction to key principles and practices that you’ll take with you throughout your career as a developer.
          <br/>
<br/>
          Get started with
          <strong>
           JavaScript
          </strong>
          .
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           Start your career in JavaScript
          </strong>
          and don't worry this course comes with a
          <strong>
           30-day money-back guarantee!

          </li>

<p>
          What you can see from reading these three reviews is that students love the technical support Ermin provides through answering questions about all of the subjects presented in the course. The lectures themselves are helpful and will inspire you to try actually doing what you see Ermin do. Then when you try to learn and have problems, you experience the greatest value of the course which is access to the instructor for help. You can ask anything related to the course and Ermin will give you a thoughtful answer which will consistently help you solve the problems you are having in learning ethical hacking and penetration testing.

</ol>
         If you answered yes to any of these questions, I would guess based on my experience teaching 50,000+ students on Udemy that you might enjoy this course. If for any reason I am wrong, you have 30 days to ask Udemy for a refund. With 98% of students enjoying this course enough to not ask for a refund and 50+ students posting good reviews, I can guess the odds of you enjoying this course are very high!Thank you very much for reading all of this! Ermin and I hope to see you as a student in the course when we next meet!

<strong>
           What exactly is Character Art School?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Character Art School is a character drawing course where you learn how to draw professional characters
          <em>
           in any style
          </em>
          for books, games, animation, manga, comics and more. I’ve hand-craftedthe The Complete Character Drawingcourse to be the only course you really need to learn all the core fundamentals, and advanced techniques to drawing and sketching characters well.
          <br/>
<br/>
          If you’re an absolute beginner or you’re already at an intermediate level, the course will advance your current drawing ability to a professional level. The course is a comprehensive 10 module guided video course, where the only limit to your progression is your determination and engagement in the rewarding assignments.
         </p>
<p>
          Whether you want to draw characters, design characters, create concept art characters for films and games, illustrations, comics, manga, Disney style or other styles,
          <strong>
           this is
           <em>
            the
           </em>
           course you need to get you there.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          I’ll teach you to draw characters without
          <em>
           fear
          </em>
          , and I’ll teach you to draw characters
          <em>
           well
          </em>
          - that's my promise to you!

<p>
<strong>
           Finally, Learn Character Drawing Well
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Whether you’re a complete beginner, or intermediate at character drawing, you’ll learn things you never knew you never knew. Seriously. Inspired by masters and built on the theory of giants, Character Art School is one of, if not
          <strong>
<em>
            themost
           </em>
           comprehensive character drawing course out there
          </strong>
          . I’m so convinced of this, I’ll give you a no-questions asked refund if you’re not satisfied.
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           Clear, Easy to Understand Lessons (Scott's No Fluff Promise!)
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Crystal clear in fact. Learning character drawing and how to draw people effectively means having information presentedin a logical and coherent way. The Character Art School Course is modular by design, easy to grasp, and allows you to learn in a well paced, structured way. Engage in the course chronologically, then revise each module at your leisure. Grasp concepts, such as how to draw lips, eyes, faces, and more, faster than you ever have before – there’s no fluff here.
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           Assignments that are Rewarding
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Bridging the gap between theory and practice, each module’s assignments have been designed to both reinforce theory, and feel rewarding. I’ve taken the core of the theory, and purpose built each assignment to help you rapidly progress, and you’ll see the difference in your own work almost immediately. Art is about doing, so let’s get started- let’s draw something awesome!

           ""Probably the best art course I've ever taken -- online or in college. Wonderfully presented, it helped me correct mistakes I'd been making that were really holding my artwork back. I've seen phenomenal progress after 30 days practice of the course material. Highly recommended.""

<em>
           ""Amazing course. I haven't even started drawing yet because I'm in awe of how simple the instructor makes even the most complicated techniques look. At last, drawing like a pro is within my grasp! I also like the fact that the instructor allows me to just watch the first time through without worrying about drawing until I'm familiar with the concepts. My next time through the course, I'll be prepared and more confident than ever to begin drawing. Even so, I've already used some of the concepts in this course for a sketch here and there when I feel inspired to draw, and I can tell worlds of difference between my former drawings and newer ones. Laid back instructor, but very knowledgeable. I highly recommend this course.""

          <em>
           any
          </em>
          web application you can possibly dream up. Docker and Kubernetes are the newest tech in the Dev Ops world, and have dramatically changed the flow of creating and deploying web apps. Docker is a technology that allows applications to run in constructs called 'containers', while Kubernetes allows for many different 'containers' to run in coordination.

<strong>
           Docker from Scratch!
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          In this course you'll
          <strong>
           learn Docker from absolute fundamentals
          </strong>
          , beginning by learning the answer to basic questions such as ""What is a container?"" and ""How does a container work?"". From the very first few lectures, we will do a
          <strong>
           deep dive on the inner workings of containers
          </strong>
          , so you get a core understanding of exactly how they are implemented. Once you understand what a container is, you'll learn how to work with them using basic Docker CLIcommands. After that, you'll apply your new-found mastery of the Docker CLI to build your own custom images, effectively 'Dockerizing' your own personal applications.

<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           CI +CDPipelines
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Of course, no course on Docker would be complete without a full understanding of common Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment patterns. You will learn how to implement
          <strong>
           a full CI + CDworkflow
          </strong>
          using Github, Travis CI, and Amazon Web Services, creating a pipeline that
          <strong>
           automatically deploys your code
          </strong>
          every time you push your latest changes to Github!
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           Multi-Container Deployments onAWS!
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          After building a deployment pipeline, you'll apply it to master both single-container and multi-container
          <strong>
           deployments on Amazon Web Services.
          </strong>
          You will construct a multi-container application utilizing
          <strong>
           Node, React, Redis, and Postgres
          </strong>
          , and see the amazing power of containers in action (Note: all Javascript coding in this course is optional, the full source code is provided if you don't want to write JS).

</p>
<p>
<strong>
           Kubernetes!
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Finally, you will tackle Kubernetes, a production-grade system for managing complex applications with many different running containers. You will learn the
          <strong>
           right way to build a Kubernetes Cluster
          </strong>
          - this course doesn't have any of those annoying
          <em>
           ""don't do this in production""
          </em>
          comments! You will first build a Kubernetes Cluster on your local machine, then eventually move it over to a cloud provider. You'll even learn how to
          <strong>
           set up HTTPS on Kubernetes
          </strong>
          , which is harder than it sounds!

           About HTML5 and CSS3
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          HTML5
         </p>
<p>
          HTML or Hyper Text Mark-up Language is the language used for presenting websites and web content. HTML5 is the latest version, made official by the World Wide Web Consortium in 2014. Having a good grasp of HTML means you’ll be able to create, present and edit a whole variety of content on the web.
         </p>
<p>
          CSS3
         </p>
<p>
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) essentially ‘enhances’ HTML, giving developers and users more control over how pages and content is displayed. It is responsible for creating more visually engaging web pages, applications and interfaces. CSS3 is the latest version, and has many more extended features than previous versions – although it is backwards compatible.

<p>
          Have you ever wondered how the webpages you visit daily come to life? How does a seemingly simple combination of text and images create an interactive and dynamic user experience? The answer lies in the trinity of web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Together, these three technologies form the backbone of modern web design and development, enabling the creation of engaging, accessible, and responsive websites.
          <br/>
<br/>
          In this introductory course, we will delve into the essentials of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a solid foundation for aspiring web developers. By the end of this course, you will have a strong understanding of these technologies and be well-equipped to embark on your journey in web development.
          <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
           HTML: The Structure of the Web
           <br/>
<br/>
</strong>
          HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the cornerstone of any webpage. At its core, HTML provides the basic structure and content of a webpage. It uses a system of tags and attributes to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. These tags act as containers for content, allowing developers to create a meaningful and organized layout for their webpages.
         </p>
<p>
          As you begin your study of HTML, you will learn about the key elements that make up the structure of a webpage. These include the doctype declaration, the html element, head and body elements, and a variety of content-specific tags. You will also explore semantic HTML, which emphasizes the use of meaningful tags to convey the purpose and structure of content, ultimately making the web more accessible and search-engine friendly.
          <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
           CSS: Styling the Web
           <br/>
<br/>
</strong>
          While HTML provides the foundation of a webpage, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) brings it to life with style and flair. CSS is a stylesheet language that allows developers to control the visual presentation of HTML elements, including colors, fonts, layout, and even animations. By separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), developers can create consistent and maintainable designs across multiple webpages.
          <br/>
<br/>
          Throughout this course, you will explore various CSS properties and selectors that allow you to target and style specific HTML elements. We will cover topics such as the box model, positioning, typography, and responsive design principles. You will learn how to create external stylesheets, enabling you to easily apply consistent styles to multiple webpages. Ultimately, you will gain an understanding of how to create visually appealing and accessible web designs.
          <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
           JavaScript: Interactivity and Dynamic Content
           <br/>
<br/>
</strong>
          The final piece of the web development puzzle is JavaScript, a powerful and versatile programming language. JavaScript breathes life into your webpages by enabling interactivity, dynamic content, and real-time updates. With JavaScript, you can create responsive user interfaces, validate user input, and even build complete web applications.
          <br/>
<br/>
          In this section of the course, you will learn the fundamentals of JavaScript, including variables, data types, functions, and control structures. You will explore the Document Object Model (DOM), a programming interface that allows JavaScript to interact with and manipulate HTML and CSS. Additionally, you will gain insight into key concepts such as event handling, asynchronous programming, and AJAX.
          <br/>
<br/>
          By understanding how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS, you will have the ability to create dynamic and engaging web experiences that respond to user input and adapt to different devices and screen sizes.
          <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
           Putting It All Together
           <br/>
<br/>
</strong>
          As you progress through this course, you will work on various hands-on projects that will help solidify your understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects will challenge you to apply the concepts you have learned, allowing you to create functional and visually appealing webpages.
          <br/>
<br/>
          By the end of this foundational course, you will be well-prepared to tackle more advanced web development topics, such as responsive design, accessibility, performance optimization, and even server-side programming. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the possibilities are endless as you continue to explore and expand your web development skills.
          <br/>
<br/>
          The skills you acquire in this course will open doors to a wide range of opportunities, whether you're interested in pursuing a career in web development, enhancing your current profession, or simply exploring a new hobby. With dedication and practice, you can become a proficient web developer, capable of creating modern, engaging, and accessible websites that cater to the ever-evolving digital landscape.
          <br/>
<br/>
          In summary, this course will provide you with a comprehensive introduction to the essential building blocks of web development: HTML for content and structure, CSS for presentation and styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic content. Together, these technologies empower you to create captivating web experiences that delight users and achieve your digital objectives.
          <br/>
<br/>
          So, are you ready to begin your journey into the world of web development? Let's get started and lay the foundations for your success in the exciting and rapidly evolving digital realm.

<p>
          Learn Network Programmability and Network Automation using GNS3 and Python version 3.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           This course is based on Python 3.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Want to program networks using Python, but not sure where to start? Well, this course will show you how you can start
          <strong>
           programming Cisco networks within 20 minutes.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          This course was created for network engineers. There are too many other Python courses out there that try to make network engineers software developers. Instead of teaching network automation, they teach you Python theory. This course is different.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           This course is practical.
          </strong>
          I won't talk about programming in abstract terms and make you wait before you can start automating networks. I will show you how you can quickly and easily start network programming by using GNS3, Cisco IOS and Python.
         </p>
<p>
          You will see demonstrations of the configuration of both Cisco routers and switches in GNS3. For example, how to configure multiple VLANs on a multiple switches, or how to configure OSPF on a router and more.
         </p>
<p>
          This course shows you practical examples of using Python to programmatically configure Cisco network devices rather then just talking about it.
         </p>
<p>
          The days of configuring Cisco networks only with the command line interface (CLI) are drawing to a close. You need to add network programmability using Python and APIs to your skill set.
         </p>
<p>
          Learn how to automate networks using:
         </p>
<p>
          - Telnet
         </p>
<p>
          - SSH
         </p>
<p>
          - Paramiko
         </p>
<p>
          -
          <strong>
           Netmiko
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          -
          <strong>
           NAPALM
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Tools such as NAPALM and Netmikomake it easy to configure and interact with network devices using an API such as NETCONF or using SSH. Don't reinvent the wheel. Use the tools available to you to quickly and easily automate your networks.

<p>
          ""Great way of explanation.Nice video and inspiring words! Thank you so much David. You are genius.""
         </p>
<p>
          ""I've been doing network automation for a while, even so, I've learned new things through this course. The instructor start from a basic example, adding improvements in each step. It's a skill that's worth it.""
         </p>
<p>
          ""A must for all network engineers who want to learn python!!! I had very ""very"" basic programming skills, and couldn't just get the bridge between network and programming (mainly Python - since that's where the hype is now), this course was amazing, I have never been glued to a training course since I can remember. The couple of things I loved the most about this course: 1- David's clear voice. 2- Real world application, not only will David interduce different real-world practical modules that you can import and use, but he shows you how to apply them on ios devices.""

          Below is a list of popular FAQs of students who want to start their Machine learning journey-
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           What is Machine Learning?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Machine Learning is a field of computer science which gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          You can divide your learning process into 3 parts:
         </p>
<p>
          Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.
         </p>
<p>
          Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model
         </p>
<p>
          Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python
         </p>
<p>
          Understanding of models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why use R for Machine Learning?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R
         </p>
<p>
          1. It’s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it’s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.
         </p>
<p>
          2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R than Python. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind.
         </p>
<p>
          3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. As compared to Python, R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science.
         </p>
<p>
          4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, usage of R and Python has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it’s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.
         </p>
<p>
          5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Like Python, adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier – and of course, it’ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you’re looking for jobs in data science.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           What are the major advantages of using R over Python?
          </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            As compared to Python, R has a higher user base and the biggest number of statistical packages and libraries available. Although, Python has almost all features that analysts need, R triumphs over Python.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            R is a function-based language, whereas Python is object-oriented. If you are coming from a purely statistical background and are not looking to take over major software engineering tasks when productizing your models, R is an easier option, than Python.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            R has more data analysis functionality built-in than Python, whereas Python relies on Packages
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Python has main packages for data analysis tasks, R has a larger ecosystem of small packages
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Graphics capabilities are generally considered better in R than in Python
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            R has more statistical support in general than Python
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
           What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge—and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.
         </p>
<p>
          Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.

          Learning
          <strong>
           Kubernetes
          </strong>
          is essential for any DevOps professional. DevOps engineers are always in demand. The average Silicon Valley salary for a DevOps engineer is 20% higher than a software engineers'.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           DevOps engineers make an average of $140,000 to $200,000 annually.
          </strong>
          And one of the most in-demand skills is
          <strong>
           Kubernetes Deployment.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating containerized application deployment, scaling, and management. It was originally designed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
          <br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           Kubernetes
          </strong>
          is at the cutting edge of application deployment. The best way to kick-start your DevOps career is by learning how to deploy Kubernetes effectively.
         </p>
<p>
          This course is for absolute
          <strong>
           Kubernetes beginners
          </strong>
          . With
          <strong>
           zero knowledge about Kubernetes
          </strong>
          , once you take this course and complete all of the hands-on coding exercises, you will be
          <strong>

<p>
<strong>
           But lectures alone won’t give you the skills you need to make it as a DevOps engineer.

<p>
          You will be developing your services using Kubernetes configuration files for different use cases in your browser. The coding exercises will validate your commands to ensure you have written them correctly.
         </p>
<p>
          After you have completed the lectures and coding exercises, you will have the opportunity to complete a series of assignments that put your new skills to the test. You will be given the challenge to solve using the Kubernetes skills you have learned.

<strong>
           Learn How to Code Dynamic Websites with PHP 5+
          </strong>
<em>
           for absolute beginners!
          </em>
</p>
<p>
          This course is a total beginners guide to coding dynamic websites with PHP so you need
          <em>
           no prior knowledge or experience with PHP —
          </em>
          although, it is a good idea if you know
          <em>
           some
          </em>
          HTML &amp; CSS.
          <em>
           (My beginner's guide Build a Website from Scratch with HTML &amp; CSS will teach you everything you need to know about HTML &amp; CSS.)
          </em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           Practical Hands-on Approach
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          My approach with this course, like many of my courses, is to take a practical ""hands on"" approach. While there will be some theory involved — every single lesson requires you to get your hands dirty and exercise what you've learned in that specific lesson. I find this to be the best approach, because you're able to retain much more of what you learned, and therefore, get up and running with maximizing your practical knowledge of PHP quickly!
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why Should I Learn PHP?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          So — why learn PHP? Well, PHP is a very powerful scripting language used by millions of websites. Some of the most popular websites and frameworks utilize PHP to build their dynamic websites. PHP works very well with HTML, and therefore will allow you to start coding dynamic websites quickly without having to learn some of the more complicated scripting languages out there.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           You Will Love This Course
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          I think you're going to love this course, and you're going to especially love what you're going to learn. When I first started learning PHP, I
          <em>
           couldn't wait
          </em>
          to start implementing what I learned into my websites! I think you'll feel the same.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           It's Totally Free!
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Also, I am excited to be offering this course
          <em>
           absolutely free
          </em>
          for three reasons:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
            I don't want a purchasing decision to get in the way of you learning what I have to offer in this course.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            I want as many people as possible to be able access the content.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            I want to give you learning material so good that it
            <em>
             should
            </em>
            cost money.
           </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
           The Final Project
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Throughout the course you will be building a handful of dynamic PHP examples, but in the last section of the course, we will build a dynamic website for a (fictional) restaurant.
         </p>
<p>
          So, I invite you to join me in learning how to Code Dynamic Websites with PHP!

          Before starting the creation of this course, our team attentively investigated feedbacks for existing courses on the Udemy platform and tried to focus on the feedbacks for the top-rated courses to understand what can be improved in this course and make it, even more, better from the quality standpoint. After analysis, we understand what will help students to learn Java in a more efficient way. In this course:
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           - High concentration of useful material in each lesson
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching other 30 minutes lessons.
         </p>
<p>
          This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes
          <strong>
<em>
            10 times as much (sometimes even 20)
           </em>
</strong>
          as the final lesson duration after video editing.
         </p>
<p>
          Only your homework and coding exercises including the EXAMtask might take approximately 20 hours to implement.
         </p>
<p>
          Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered.
         </p>

<strong>
           - Relevant knowledge
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!
         </p>
<p>
          The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IToutsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 18 thousand people across all over the world (BTWmost of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha.
         </p>
<p>
          With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best ITconsultants in the world.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           - Sequence of lessons
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          After the years of teaching offline, and based on the feedback of students who are passing online courses we realized how important the sequence of lessons is while teaching Java. The same issue is with the books where information is completely unstructured what makes things even more complex. For example, how students can learn object-oriented programming from the first lesson if they don't know yet the java syntax basics?Or how a student can implement a home task if he/she doesn't aware of java methods specifics, or doesn't know yet how to read program input?
         </p>
<p>
          So in this course, you can be sure, that you will not get a home task to implement without having enough information to implement it. The program which is in this course is proven by many students who completed it offline and now work as software engineers in outsourcing companies and as freelancers.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           - Interview practice tests
           <br/>
<br/>
</strong>
          Being an IT consultant in different companies, the tutor of this course was in charge of driving the interview process in companies to make sure, that company selects the best people. That's why the first interview is always test. In case the test is completed, the candidate is invited to have a conversation. That's why in this course we want to prepare you to complete tests successfully!
         </p>
<p>
          Especially for our students, we prepared tests that could be used to evaluate their knowledge during the interview process.
         </p>
<p>
          2 tests. 90 questions each
          <strong>
           (180 interview tests in total).
          </strong>
          120 minutes each.
         </p>
<p>
          You can read explanations for answers! That also can help you to learn the material better. Don't wait, try it now!
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           - Q&amp;A support
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          The significant difference between the online and offline learning processes is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concepts or to help fix your code on your computer.
          <br/>
          In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
            So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?:)), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course.
           </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           - Open source code
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          We hide nothing from our students!Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           - Free mobile App without limits for our students
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes.
         </p>
<p>
          In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREEmobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms)
         </p>
<p>
          The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview.
         </p>
<p>
          Also,
          <strong>
<em>
            only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification.
           </em>
</strong>
          In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           - Coding exercises
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          To learn to program is not enough just watching videos and reading books. You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will have different practical tasks which will help you learn and understand Java better.
         </p>
<p>
          One of the key tasks where you can practice your knowledge is the implementation of a backend system for an online store. Also, you have a lot of tasks that use domain-specific terminology:accounts, transactions, users, carts, menu, services, etc. So that means you are learning programming without abstract concepts like it is written in the books or in other courses. You learn domain-specific terminology and during the lessons, we investigate specific extracts from code that can give you a clear vision of how you can apply the knowledge in real life.
         </p>

           C++
          </strong>
</p>

          Which programming language can you learn that when added to your resume, will often get you a job interview?
          <strong>
           C++
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Which programming language is routinely ranked in the top 5 programming languages by popularity, and been consistently in the top 10 for close to 20 years?
          <strong>
           C++
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why you should learn C++
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Much, if not most of the software written today is still written in C++ and this has been the case for many, many years.
         </p>
<p>
          Not only is C++ popular, but itis also a very relevant language. If you go to GitHub you will see that there are a huge number of active C++ repositories and C++ is also extremely active on stack overflow.
         </p>
<p>
          There are many, many leading software titles written entirely or partly in C++.These include the Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX operating systems!
         </p>
<p>
          Many of the Adobe products such as Photoshop and Illustrator, the MySQL and MongoDB database engines, and many many more are written in C++.
         </p>
<p>
          Leading tech companies use C++ for many of their products and internal research and development. These include Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, PayPal, Google, Facebook, Oracle, and many more.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Can you see how learning C++ will open up more career opportunities for you?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          If more professional companies are using C++, it stands to reason that there is going to be more of a demand for C++ programmers.
         </p>
<p>
          But the main reason programmers should probably learn C++ is because it is so powerful!
         </p>
<p>
          What do I mean by powerful?
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           C++ issuper fast andis a general-purpose programming language that supports both procedure and object-oriented programming making it very flexible.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          It can scale easily. And it can be portable as well.
         </p>
<p>
          C++ can do many things that other languages just can't.
         </p>
<p>
          That's why nearly every major language has a way to interface with code written in C++.
         </p>
<p>
          Since C++ has influenced so many languages, if you know C++ you'll likely see elements from C++ in new languages you learn.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           How can a beginner learn C++?
          </strong>
<br/>
<br/>
          Finda good course, taught by an instructor with many years of experience in C++ is critical, as is the need for the instructor to have the necessary skills to be able to teach you the language.
         </p>
<p>
          Frank Mitropolous, the instructor in this course has been using C++ for over 2 decades and has taught students in both university courses and industry training courses. He even worked on a C++ compiler development project while he was in the industry.
         </p>
<p>
          So notonly will you be learning C++ from an expert C++ programmer, but you'll also be taught by an instructor who has successfully taughtat university level for many years.
         </p>
<p>
          As a result, you can take this course with confidence, knowing that you will learn C++ the right way, and in the shortest possible timeframe.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Which version of C++ should I learn?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          C++ has had many version releases and updates over the years. It's a sad fact that most C++ courses do not teach Modern C++, but focus on old, obsolete versions of C++.
         </p>
<p>
          Frank teaches you Modern C++ (specifically C++ 14 and C++17).
         </p>
<p>
          Learn C++ the right way, with Modern C++, as taught by Frank in this course.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           What about C++20? Don't I need to learn about that as well?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          This course currently covers C++14 and C++17 but is still valid if you ultimately want to learn C++20.
         </p>
<p>
          C++20 is new and the reality is that C++20 compilers and tools are not yet ready for prime time and the industry is using mainly C++14. So it's not really of any benefit for you to learn C++20 right now when the industry is not using it.
         </p>
<p>
          It's going to take many, many years for the industry to migrate to C++20 and that means jobs for C++20 are not going to be around for quite some time.
          <br/>
<br/>
          What is available right now, are tons of jobs for Modern C++ developers, and you will obtain those skills in this course.
          <br/>
<br/>
          It's our sincere advice to focus on learning Modern C++ and not get too hung up on the latest and greatest versions of C++.
          <br/>
<br/>
          And even if you really do want to learn C++20, the new features in C++20 are mostly advanced features that require understanding the foundations of Modern C++.
          <br/>
<br/>
          If you don't learn the basics, you won't master any version of C++.
         </p>
<p>
          Learning the foundations of Modern C++ should be your priority, which you will learn in this course!
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Is C++ difficult to learn?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          With all the power and flexibility of C++ comes complexity.
         </p>
<p>
          There is no question that C++ is one of the most complex programming languages out there.
         </p>
<p>
          But with the right instructor and the right training, you really canget up to speed with C++ quickly,and that's what this course is all about.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           What will I learn in this course?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          The course assumes no previous experience with C++ (or even programming in general), and you will end up with the skills to create your own programs in C++.
         </p>
<p>
          Key topics covered include.
         </p>
<p>
          * Looping with while, do/while for, range-based for statements and recursion
          <br/>

<strong>
           How is this C++ course different from other courses?
           <br/>
<br/>
</strong>
          You will learn Modern C++, for one.
          <strong>
           Many, perhaps most other courses on Udemy teach you old, obsolete versions of C++.
          </strong>
          If you are going to learn C++, it's imperative that you learn the Modern version to maximize your career opportunities and to ensure your skills are up to date.
         </p>
<p>
          The course format includes theory and concepts which are then reinforced with live code examples. Often the C++ debugger is used to step through code and analyze variables to better understand the behavior of C++. The instructor also uses a pen tablet to write on the screen and provide even more visual explanations.
         </p>
<p>
          You won't find better C++ training anywhere, and you will struggle to find someone with as much industry and training experience asyour instructor Frank has.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           What do I get out of learning C++?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          More career options for one! C++ is one of the most popular programming languages used in games development.  It's also heavily used in embedded applications. Your investment in time in learning C++ will reward you time and time again with more pay, and more opportunities, and frankly, more fun!

<p>
          QUITE POSSIBLY THE FASTEST WAY TO LEARN HOW TO BUILD PROFESSIONAL QUALITY WEBSITES FOR BEGINNERS, NON-PROGRAMMERS AND ENTREPRENEURS
         </p>
<p>
          So you want to learn how to build websites but you're not quite sure how.
         </p>
<p>
          Welllllll, you could do like me and spend months learning every knook and cranny of HTML and CSS before you even put up your first webpage. This could lead to frustration, feelings of being overwhelmed and highly increases the chances that you'll give up without a site to show for it.
         </p>
<p>
          OR….. YOU COULD START LEARNING BY DOING AND HAVE YOUR FIRST WEBSITE UP THIS WEEK.
         </p>
<p>
          If you want to learn something fast you need to jump in and start getting your hands dirty from the beginning. Have you ever noticed that you don't really learn something until you actually try to do it, and experience it firsthand? Well that's exactly what we'll do in this course. You'll learn by building your first website this week.
         </p>
<p>
          And don't worry if HTML and CSS or websites in general intimidate you. Learning to build websites is actually a lot easier than you think...if you are taught correctly. And I'll be here with you the whole time. I personally respond to and answer all questions you and other students have.
         </p>
<p>
          Through project-based learning and leveraging powerful, free tools that exist online, I will teach you what you need to know in order to create rock star sites fast and not get frustrated trying to learn HTML and CSS FOR-EV-ERRRRR (insert Sandlot voice here) without having a site up to show for it.
         </p>
<p>
          The simple truth is that most courses and instructors out there try to teach you too much too early, don't teach things in the right order, or sometimes it even seems like they purposefully make the material too hard.
         </p>
<p>
          With this course I PROMISE YOU that you will learn to build websites and put them online in less than 10 hours of work total.
         </p>

<p>
          Welcome! This is
          <strong>
           Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Data Science Prerequisites: The Numpy Stack in Python
          </strong>
          .
         </p>
<p>
          One question or concern I get a lot is that people want to learn deep learning and data science, so they take these courses, but they get left behind because they don’t know enough about the Numpy stack in order to turn those concepts into code.
         </p>
<p>
          Even if I write the code in full, if you don’t know Numpy, then it’s still very hard to read.
         </p>
<p>
          This course is designed to remove that obstacle - to show you how to do things in the Numpy stack that are frequently needed in deep learning and data science.
         </p>
<p>
          So what are those things?
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Numpy
          </strong>
          . This forms the basis for everything else. The central object in Numpy is the Numpy array, on which you can do various operations.
         </p>
<p>
          The key is that a Numpy array isn’t just a regular array you’d see in a language like Java or C++, but instead is like a mathematical object like a vector or a matrix.
         </p>
<p>
          That means you can do vector and matrix operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
         </p>
<p>
          The most important aspect of Numpy arrays is that they are optimized for speed. So we’re going to do a demo where I prove to you that using a Numpy vectorized operation is faster than using a Python list.
         </p>
<p>
          Then we’ll look at some more complicated matrix operations, like products, inverses, determinants, and solving linear systems.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Pandas.
          </strong>
          Pandas is great because it does a lot of things under the hood, which makes your life easier because you then don’t need to code those things manually.
         </p>
<p>
          Pandas makes working with datasets a lot like R, if you’re familiar with R.
         </p>
<p>
          The central object in R and Pandas is the DataFrame.
         </p>
<p>
          We’ll look at how much easier it is to load a dataset using Pandas vs. trying to do it manually.
         </p>
<p>
          Then we’ll look at some dataframe operations useful in machine learning, like filtering by column, filtering by row, and the apply function.
         </p>
<p>
          Pandas dataframes will remind you of SQLtables, so if you have an SQL background and you like working with tables then Pandas will be a great next thing to learn about.
         </p>
<p>
          Since Pandas teaches us how to load data, the next step will be looking at the data. For that we will use
          <strong>
           Matplotlib
          </strong>
          .
         </p>
<p>
          In this section we’ll go over some common plots, namely the line chart, scatter plot, and histogram.
         </p>
<p>
          We’ll also look at how to show images using Matplotlib.
         </p>
<p>
          99% of the time, you’ll be using some form of the above plots.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Scipy
          </strong>
          .
         </p>
<p>
          I like to think of Scipy as an addon library to Numpy.
         </p>
<p>
          Whereas Numpy provides basic building blocks, like vectors, matrices, and operations on them, Scipy uses those general building blocks to do specific things.
         </p>
<p>
          For example, Scipy can do many common statistics calculations, including getting the PDF value, the CDF value, sampling from a distribution, and statistical testing.
         </p>
<p>
          It has signal processing tools so it can do things like convolution and the Fourier transform.
         </p>
<p>
          In sum:
         </p>
<p>
          If you’ve taken a deep learning or machine learning course, and you understand the theory, and you can see the code, but you can’t make the connection between how to turn those algorithms into actual running code, this course is for you.
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
          ""If you can't implement it, you don't understand it""
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            Or as the great physicist Richard Feynman said: ""What I cannot create, I do not understand"".
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            My courses are the ONLY courses where you will learn how to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Other courses will teach you how to plug in your data into a library, but do you really need help with 3 lines of code?
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            After doing the same thing with 10 datasets, you realize you didn't learn 10 things. You learned 1 thing, and just repeated the same 3 lines of code 10 times...
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
          Suggested Prerequisites:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            matrix arithmetic
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            probability
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Python coding: if/else, loops, lists, dicts, sets
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            you should already know ""why"" things like a dot product, matrix inversion, and Gaussian probability distributions are useful and what they can be used for
           </p>

           <br/>
           The Complete React JS Course - Basics to Advanced
          </strong>
          this course is a complete guide for
          <strong>
           React JS
          </strong>
          . Here, you will learn all the concepts required for becoming a
          <strong>
           front-end React JS developer
          </strong>
          . If you are new to web development or a professional developer who's creating websites with plain old javascript or jQuery, this is your time to learn React JS and take your web development skills to the next level and impress your recruiter or clients.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           React JS
          </strong>
          is gaining rapid popularity. In a very short time, it has become the most widely accepted web development JavaScript library. This is the right time for you to learn and add React JS to your skillset and excel in your career.
         </p>
<p>
          This course is designed in a way that anyone can understand the journey from the
          <strong>
           basics to advanced concepts of React
          </strong>
          with simple explanations by the instructor along with
          <strong>
           hands-on assignments and projects.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           In the first part of this course:
          </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            We cover what is React JS, how it uses JSX, how the compilation is done behind the scenes using babel to browser understandable plain old HTML, CSS, and javascript.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            After that, we explain 'components' which are the basic building blocks of a web page while working with React JS. We also cover the stateless and stateful components and when to use those components as well.
           </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
          In the
          <strong>
           next section
          </strong>
          , we learn
          <strong>
           how to create modules in React JS
          </strong>
          and
          <strong>
           how to import or export those modules to other files
          </strong>
          so that we can reuse the same set of code.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           In the following section
          </strong>
          , we will work on
          <strong>
           how do we style the components using CSS modules
          </strong>
          and
          <strong>
           how to create a nice user-friendly mobile responsive website.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          We also cover
          <strong>
           how to work with props
          </strong>
          ,
          <strong>
           how to pass data from stateful to stateless components
          </strong>
          , and
          <strong>
           how to pass functions from one component to another component.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          We
          <strong>
           explain the different lifecycle methods
          </strong>
          of a React Component and
          <strong>
           how we can access
          </strong>
          and modify the data between these lifecycles using the various lifecycle methods available to us.

<em>
            Are you a beginner? Do you want to learn web development but do not have any idea where to start?
           </em>
</strong>
<br/>
          If yes, then this is THE perfect course for you. In the HTML course, you will learn all the concepts of HTML5, starting from its history to its modern structure. We will cover all the tags which are most widely used in the world of web development. Simultaneously, we will show you some of the best practices of code-writing in HTML5.
         </p>
<p>
          HTML is short for 'HyperText Markup Language', which means HTML is only used to create a structure of the web page. But without some styling, no assignment or project will look good. Thus, we will cover some portion of the CSS required to create simple web pages.
         </p>
<p>
          This HTML course will be beneficial for all who are looking to start their career in the web development field and aspire to become a Frontend or Full-stack web developer. This HTML course will be the first step towards your goal to become a web developer. To continue this journey, we would recommend you complete the other languages and skills like CSS, JavaScript, ES6, React.

<strong>
           Why ReactJs?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          You know Companies Worldwide
          <strong>
           Require React JS Developers.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          React.js is one of the most demanding frameworks in the market;31.3% of worldwide specialists are currently utilizing ReactJs. Some of the world’s top tech teams use the tool to design scalable, easy-to-maintain solutions — Netflix, PayPal, eBay, Airbnb, and more. Why are businesses so interested in React.js implementation? Here are the benefits of adopting the framework:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Increased app development speed.
            </strong>
            The framework accepts HTML code input and has excellent subcomponent rendering support. Development teams can benefit from JSX as well — it’s an extension with a range of shortcuts that cuts the amount of code writing time.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Improved code stability
            </strong>
            . React.js reduces the impact of change in the code file since the changes in parent components don’t affect the children. Such a data binding approach facilitates software testing and helps ensure stable app performance after update deployments.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             SEO-friendliness.
            </strong>
            React.js deals with the inability of search engine crawlers to process JS-heavy pages. Even a beginner with an entry-level react developer salary can deploy React on a server and use the virtual DOM to view the code as a regular web page in a browser.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Robust toolkit.
            </strong>
            React.js has a wide range of debugging and interface design tools.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Strong user community and an affordable remote react developer salary.
            </strong>
            Since a large number of teams are deploying the framework, the tool is regularly updated. There’s no shortage of user-generated content either — you can find dozens of helpful React tutorials and case studies to make the most out of the framework.
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
          Asking for a Senior react developer salary. It’s one of the most in-demand frameworks at the moment — that’s why business owners are willing to find professionals with a moderate mid-level react developer salary within and beyond their home regions.

Make Money from Home: How to Build an Online Business,4.6,5620,Udemy,mike omar,https://www.classcentral.com/course/udemy-how-to-build-an-online-business-a-complete--32852/visit,/provider/udemy,"['Udemy', 'Paid Course', 'English', 'Certificate Available', '11 hours worth of material', 'On-Demand', 'Beginner', 'English']",Learn all the basics of online entrepreneurship while building a real business with your own portfolio of websites.,"What you'll learn:
         </b>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
           To build a $5,000 / month passive income website portfolio.
          </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>
          HOW TO MAKE MONEY ONLINE: Learn how to make money from home with my step-by-step plan to build a $5,000 per month passive income website portfolio (based on building 10 websites that make at least $500 per month each).
         </p>
<p>
          In association with the Make Money from Home LIONS CLUB.
         </p>
<p>
          NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE REQUIRED. ALL INSTRUCTIONS ARE FULLY DETAILED AND STEP-BY-STEP SO ANYONE CAN FOLLOW THEM EASILY.
         </p>
<p>
          Online passive income is the ultimate dream. Making money while you sleep. Everybody wants it.
         </p>
<p>
          But is it really possible?
         </p>
<p>
          The short answer is ""yes.""
         </p>
<p>
          The longer answer is ""yes, but it isn't easy to accomplish.""
         </p>
<p>
          If it was, wouldn't everyone be doing it?
         </p>
<p>
          In my course, I give you a step-by-step plan on how to develop a passive income website portfolio and show you how making money online actually works.
         </p>
<p>
          The specific plan I teach is designed to make you $5,000 per month in passive income earnings, based on 10 websites, with each website having a targeted earnings level of at least $500 each. Once you understand the process though, you can decide to build 20 of these websites, or 100! When you stop is up to you (and yes, there are people making tens of thousands of dollars per month on the Internet based on these concepts - they just love the work and don't ever stop building new websites or expanding their current ones!).
         </p>
<p>
          What's great about the business plan that I teach you is not only the income level you will accomplish if you follow through, but all that you will learn in the process. The first lesson you are taught is how to build a website or blog using WordPress on your own domain (without having to learn how to code). The skills you learn in this course will enable you to build all kinds of online businesses and open the door for all kinds of entrepreneurial projects you may have.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Note
          </strong>
          : When I say we will be creating a website using WordPress, I don't mean creating one through the WordPress website. Websites created through the WordPress website are severely limited in what you can do with them and offer very little flexibility overall. The method I teach enables you to create truly professional websites by installing the WordPress software and you won't be limited in any way.
         </p>
<p>
          Not only that, you will be able to evaluate business ideas much more intelligently once you've gone through this whole process. You will understand the fundamentals of keyword research &amp; analysis, traffic &amp; lead generation, social &amp; affiliate marketing, monetization &amp; conversion testing, and traffic analysis. These skills will help you immensely in ANY business you ever decide to start (online or not, passive or not).
         </p>
<p>
          Generating an online passive income won't happen overnight and takes a lot of hard work, but going through the process is completely worth it and having an exact plan of action is the ONLY way to ensure success.
         </p>
<p>
          Let me put it this way: if you were offered no pay for six months for 40+ hours of work per week, but after those six months, you got $5,000+ per month for the rest of your life, would that be worth it to you?
         </p>
<p>
          If that idea isn't unbelievably exciting to you, then this isn't the business for you.
         </p>
<p>
          This isn't a get rich quick scheme. This is a business. Except with this business, instead of trading your time for money (like most jobs), you are investing your time. You work hard now and continue to reap the benefits indefinitely. Building an online business takes a lot of work and a lot of patience, but the rewards can be amazing.
         </p>
<p>
          That's the kind of business I teach you in this course.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           NOTE
          </strong>
          : Throughout my course you will be referred to video lessons. While everything in video lessons are as up to date as possible (I frequently update the video lessons), the place to check for the most up-to-date information is in the
          <em>
           video descriptions
          </em>
          (on the same page you watch the videos). This can be the video descriptions on the pages of the LIONS CLUB website, or the video description of the Udemy or YouTube pages. Be sure to read the video descriptions of each video
          <em>
           before
          </em>
          watching the video itself.

           What does the pay look like?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          According to PayScale,
          <strong>
           the average salary for an Agile Coach is $124,334 per year
          </strong>
          which can oscillate between $86K - $163K per year depending on the years of experience and level of expertise. Now according to Glassdoor, the national average salary for an Agile Coach is $137,881 per year in United States and oscillates between $96K - $197K per year. Either way, the point is Agile coaches enjoy very attractive salaries. And even if you don't become an Agile coach, having Agile skills, training and an Agile Certification in your resume will lead to a higher salary and an increased amount of job opportunities. Particularly since you will often see Agile listed as an expected skill for job applicants in any role.

           What are the advantages of Agile Project Management?
          </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            In Agile Project Management you deliver projects faster.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Agile Project Managementfosters an environment of constant collaboration, teamwork and focus on execution.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            In Agile Project Management you have direct input from your customer throughout the whole project.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            In Agile Project Management udemy you constantly reflect for improvement with sessions called Retrospectives.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Agile Project Management shifts from traditional long documentation processes and long meetings to agile, lean processes, practices and rituals such as the daily standup.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            In Agile Project Management roles blur, meaning everyone can participate on different tasks regardless of whether it's their ""official"" role or not. For example, not only testers test, but others too (if the teams decides that).
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Agile Project Management udemy, allows you to focus on value and the minimum required working solution known as the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). So you apply a basic/yet really important concept all the time: keep it simple!!! Don't build a Ferrari if all you need is a skateboard!
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Visual boards (Kanbans) and reports (burn down charts), are a key part of Agile Project Management udemy. It allows everyone to stay on the same page and be able to understand speed of execution, areas of improvement and more.

<strong>
           Can I add these Agile Project Management Certifications to my Resume?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Yes, of course! You can add these Agile Project Management Certifications to your Resume. I recommend you add it under a heading called ""Professional Development,"" then, just add the course title, year of completion and Udemy at the end. Same goes for the AgileKB Certificate. But wait, that's not all! We'll even provide you with a Resume example, which you can use as a reference to create your own or you can edit it to suit your specific needs.

<strong>
           Does a Udemy Agile Project Management Certification have any value in the real world?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Of course it does! Even though Udemy is not a University and does not provide ""accredited"" certifications (like the one you would get from a University), Udemy is the most important online education platform in the modern world with over 52 Million users worldwide. So it definitely carries weight and it is also globally worldwide. So rest assured adding this Agile Project Management Certification to your resume increases your probability of getting that dream job in an Agile environment or Project Management. Udemy is a public listed company in the NASDAQ stock exchange with a market capitalization of almost $2 Billion dollars.

           Organic and Paid Search Results
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Google has two different categories of search results that it displays – paid and organic. There is a BIG difference in the way these two types of results are ranked. With organic search results, there are many more ranking factors that you will need to consider if you want to perform well in search. When it comes to paid results, advertisers are ranked according to the amount they’ll pay a single visitor, sent to them through Google’s Pay Per Click Ad’s network. The more they are willing to pay the higher they will rank. It’s as simple as that.
         </p>
<p>
          Organic search doesn’t work in the same way. You can’t pay your way to the top. Instead, you need to optimise your site, pages, and content so you score highly in Google’s ranking algorithm. The good news is, when people search for information on a topic, most people trust organic search results FAR more than they trust paid results.
         </p>
<p>
          In this video, we’ll be focusing solely on organic results, and giving you tips and advice you can use to perform well in organic Google search.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why do you need SEO?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Search engines will be one of the main sources of traffic to your webpage and Google is the biggest and most popular search engine, by far. Google searches create over half of ALL the traffic on the entire internet, so you can see why it makes sense to optimise your site for Google’s algorithm.
         </p>
<p>
          When it’s applied correctly, SEO can help your website rank for 100’s of related keywords in your niche, generating 1000’s of visitors on each of those phrases every month.
         </p>
<p>
          People using paid results would pay a premium for this amount of traffic but by applying some smart SEO principles, you can get it all - for free. Let’s look at some of the things you can do to score highly with Google, so you can start getting a consistent stream of traffic to your website.

          While WordPress might seem scary from the outside, once you get started, it's fairly intuitive.

           Why learn WordPress from me?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          I've been building WordPress websites for years. Just like you, there was a time when I was a complete newbie! I was honestly scared of starting a WordPress website because it seemed so daunting.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Now I love WordPress!
          </strong>
          I wouldn't recommend using any other web-building tool.

<p>
          I still remember what it is like to be a beginner, and I've kept that in mind while creating this entire course. I walk you through every process step-by-step to make sure you understand things clearly. And if there is ever anything that is confusing, just let me know and I'll create more lessons that explain or walk you through myself.

If you've built a website on another platform like Wix, Weebly, GoDaddy, or others, that's fine too. This course is not for people trying to learn to code a custom Website. In this course, we'll learn how to use the thousands of themes and plugins already out there to design our own custom websites.

<p>
<strong>
           Here are three types of students who will love this course:
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           Student #1:
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Has some JavaScript experience and is interested in what this language can do. You heard and read that JavaScript allows you to create nice web applications and enhance existing web pages. VueJS is your choice!
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Student #2:
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          You already have some experience with other frontend frameworks like Angular (2+) or ReactJS. But either due to interest or disappointment of the existing frameworks, you seek some alternatives - VueJS might be what you were looking for!
         </p>
<p>

           Student #3:

          This introductory course to Photoshop covers the fundamental functions to get started editing and improving photos. The student learns how to customize workspaces and panels, navigate the canvas effectively, work with multiple images and file types, and use various methods of image enhancement, including layering, selecting, and masking. Support files are included for this course, so students can follow along in the hands-on lectures. If you're a beginner to Photoshop or simply want to learn more about various selections, layering, and masking techniques, this course is for you!
         </p>
<p>
          The course is structured in a way to maximize learning. I first go over how to do basic functions in Photoshop like
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            Adjusting settings of new documents
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Navigating around the canvas
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Cycling through screen modes
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Working with multiple images
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Cropping and resizing images
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
          I then go over into more detailed instruction, in which the students continue to follow along and learn more about
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            Layering images
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Layer blending modes
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Adjustment layers
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Layer styles
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Making selections
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Masking layers
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Color and lighting corrections
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
          The course includes follow-along exercises that involve using layering and masking to create a “text in photo"" clipping mask effect, a high dynamic range landscape adjustment, and a selective sharpening portrait edit. You will also learn by creating images for online advertising and social media in Photoshop.
         </p>
<p>
          I have years of experience using Photoshop, including doing web and advertising design at a newspaper, an advertising design firm, a library system, and freelance work for about two decades. I've also been managing editor at two international graphic design magazines, and I'm currently a full-time professor of graphic design and digital media. I've taken classes on digital production and design during my undergraduate and graduate work.
         </p>
<p>
          So enroll today and let's learn about Photoshop and its amazing capabilities of photo editing and digital effects.

          The best part of it is the hands-on approach which the author maintained throughout the course as he had promised at the beginning of the lecture. He explains the concepts really well and also makes sure that there is not a single line of code you type without understanding what it really does.

          I also appreciate the mind and hands approach of teaching something and then having the student apply it. It makes everything a lot clearer for the student and uncovers issues that we will face in our project early.

          This course is about improving your ability to learn new skills or information
          <em>
           quickly and effectively
          </em>
          . We go far beyond the kinds of ""speed-reading"" (or glorified skimming) you may have been exposed to, diving into the
          <em>
           actual cognitive and neurological factors
          </em>
          that make learning easier and more successful. We also give you advanced memory techniques to grapple with the huge loads of information you'll be able to process.
         </p>
<p>
          You'll learn how to input and retain information in a whole new way - a faster, better way
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           The core of this SuperLearning course involves 3 ""Super Skills"":
          </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            Speed-reading with high (80%+) comprehension and understanding
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Memory techniques for storing and recalling vast amounts of information quickly and accurately
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Developing the cognitive infrastructure to support this flood of new information long-term
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
          However, the SuperLearning skills you'll learn in this course are applicable to many aspects of your every day life, from remembering phone numbers to acquiring new skills or even speaking new languages.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           How this new course will change your life and triple your learning speed:
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          The sad irony is that in order to learn most of these superlearning skills and memory techniques in the past, you had to read dozens of books and psychological journals. Or, you had to hire an expensive private tutor who specializes in superlearning. That's what I did. And it changed my life.
         </p>
<p>
          Fortunately, my instructors (experts in the fields of superlearning, memory techniques, and speed-reading) agreed to help me transform their materials into the first ever digital course. That course,
          <em>
           Become a SuperLearner™ 1.0,
          </em>
          took the internet by storm, becoming one of the top courses in the history of Udemy, and resulting in a bestselling book and top-ranking podcast.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           How is it different from SuperLearner® 1.0?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Over the last 2 years and 50,000+ students, we’ve had tens of thousands of data points and pieces of feedback, helping us improve both our methodology and our teaching practices. This new course has more (and better) content than ever before, including:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            Completely re-written lectures emphasizing clarity and engagement!
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            All-new lectures on topics never before covered!
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Hands-on demonstration videos for every major concept
           </p>

<p>
            Dramatically improved video and audio quality
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>

           </p>
</li>
<li>

           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
          We can confidently say that this is the best, most comprehensive accelerated learning product we’ve ever released on Udemy.
         </p>
<p>
          The course will require 2-3 hours of memory and speed-reading practice and training per week, and last roughly 7-9 weeks. It won't be easy - but if you put in the work, you are guaranteed to succeed.
         </p>
<p>
          In addition to the lectures, there is an additional 1.5 hours of supplemental video content from TED, YouTube, and other sources which are considered part of the course curriculum.

         </p>
<p>
          If you got
          <strong>
           basic Node.js experience
          </strong>
          , this course is also a perfect match because you can go through the basic modules quickly and you'll benefit from all the deep dives and advanced topics the course covers.

<strong>
           Stuck at home or quarantine and want to learn how to make videos to grow your online business or personal brand?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          If you have never edited a video before and want to learn while you are stuck at home, join over 200,000 students (in all platforms) in one of the largest and most popular video editing courses for beginner's.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           This course is a one-stop-shop that has everything you need to become a confident editor inside Premiere Pro.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          If you've taken a quick look at Adobe Premiere Pro and are completely overwhelmed by the features and have no clue how to start editing your first video, you have come to the right course.
         </p>
<p>
          For the first few months of my editing journey, I battled the same problems you have and I felt like I'd never figure it out. Adobe Premiere Pro seemed so complicated and the learning curve was painful.
         </p>
<p>
          As a self-taught video editor with 5+ years experience exclusively with Adobe Premiere Pro, I am proud to say that I am truly happy with the quality of the videos I am producing for YouTube. I wish I had this course when I first started, it would have saved me years of pain and suffering!
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           What You'll Learn In This Course

           What makes me qualified to teach you?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          I'm a self-taught video editor and full time vlogger that started off like you!
         </p>
<p>
          In 2016, I had zero video editing experience, no laptop, no students and no YouTube channel. Fast forward to April 2021, I have;
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            650+ videos on my vlogging YouTube channel
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Almost 12,000 YouTube subscribers with over 7.44 million minutes watched
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            275,000+ students in my online video courses
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Over 5,000 reviews
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
          Trust me, as I review my stats it sounds crazy to me too! I never expected in a million years to be in my current position with these achievements. I started with nothing. If I can do it, I am confident that you can do it too.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           What Makes This Course Different?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          My ambition with this course is to take 5 years of my video editing knowledge and experience, and put it in an easy-to-follow course so you can learn in 1 week what has taken the last 5 years to learn. This course is the most comprehensive beginner editing course where, by the end of the course, you'll feel confident editing your own amazing video projects.

         </p>
<p>
          Here are some more details of what you get with The Business Intelligence Analyst Course:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Introduction to Data and Data Science
            </strong>
            – Make sense of terms like business intelligence, traditional and big data, traditional statistical methods, machine learning, predictive analytics, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and many more;
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Statistics and Excel
            </strong>
            – Understand statistical testing and build a solid foundation. Modern software packages and programming languages are automating most of these activities, but this part of the course gives you something more valuable – critical thinking abilities;
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Database theory
            </strong>
            – Before you start using SQL, it is highly beneficial to learn about the underlying database theory and acquire an understanding of why databases are created and how they can help us manage data
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             SQL
            </strong>
            - when you can work with SQL, it means you don’t have to rely on others sending you data and executing queries for you. You can do that on your own. This allows you to be independent and dig deeper into the data to obtain the answers to questions that might improve the way your company does its business
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Tableau
            </strong>
            – one of the most powerful and intuitive data visualization tools available out there. Almost all large companies use such tools to enhance their BI capabilities. Tableau is the #1 best-in-class solution that helps you create powerful charts and dashboards
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Learning a programming language is meaningless without putting it to use. That’s why we integrate SQL and Tableau, and perform several real-life Business Intelligence tasks
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
           Sounds amazing, right?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Our courses are unique because our team works hard to:
         </p>

            Pre-script the entire content

<strong>
           Just Updated for 2023!
          </strong>
          Become a Fullstack Web Developer by learning the most in demand skills!
          <strong>
           Graduates of this course are now working at companies like Google, Tesla, Amazon, Apple, Shopify, JP Morgan, Facebook + other top tech companies (...seriously).
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           Join a live online community of over 900,000+ developers and a course taught by an industry expert that has actually worked both in Silicon Valley and Toronto as a Senior Developer and Tech Lead.
          </strong>
<br/>
<br/>
          This is
          <em>
           the
          </em>
          tutorial you've been looking for to
          <strong>
           become a modern web developer in 2023.
          </strong>
          It doesn’t just cover a small portion of the industry. This covers everything you need to know to get hired: from absolute zero knowledge to being able to put things on your resume that will allow you to live the life you want.
         </p>
<p>
          Sounds too good to be true? Give me 5 minutes of your time to explain why I built this WebDevelopment course and what is different here than thousands of other courses all over the internet:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             I update the course every month to make sure you learn the most up to date skills!
            </strong>
            There is no wasted time here. We won’t be using outdated technologies like PHP, Wordpress and JQuery. Although still useful, outdated technologies like the above are low paying and demands for them are decreasing. In this course, you will learn the specific technologies that are the most in demand in the industry right now. These include
            <strong>
             tools and technologies used by the biggest tech companies like Google, Facebook, Instagram, etc… It is geared specifically for people that want to learn employable skills in 2023.
             <br/>
<br/>
</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            After finishing this course, you will be able to apply for developer roles, get a promotion, or upgrade your job title as a developer and earn a higher salary. We won't be taking any shortcuts in this course.
            <strong>
             You are going to gofrom absolute zero: where you learn how the internet works. To mastery: where you build an image recognition app using aMachine Learning API (a subset of Artificial Intelligence) and all the other modern technologies that we learn in the course.Most students have commented how the projects in this course have impressed their interviewers and allowed them to get an offer.
             <br/>

</p>

<li>
<p>
            This course is taught by an instructor who has worked in Silicon Valley, and one of the top tech companies in Toronto.
            <strong>
             I have built large scale applications, and have managed teams of developers. I am not an online marketer or a salesman, but a software developer who has worked directly with these technologies. I love programming and believe that there needs to be a course out there that actually teaches valuable real life skills (because most of them are taught by teachers with no work experience).
             <br/>
<br/>
</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Your time is valuable and you don't want to spend thousands of dollars on a bootcamp. You want a course that outlines the best way to become a Web Developer, in simple and well explained terms, so that you fully understand topics instead of watching somebody on your screen and having no clue what is going on.
            <strong>
             I have taken the best pieces, tools, and practices that I have found over the years, and condensed everything into this course. 50 hours of videos doesn't mean much if the instructor isn't engaging or focuses on outdated topics.I made sure that everything covered in this course is efficient and focuses on getting you job ready as soon as possible!
             <br/>
<br/>
</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Wehave a thriving online chat community so you really feel like you are part of a classroom and not just watching videos by yourself.
            </strong>
            You will have a chance to communicate with fellow students, work on group projects together, and contribute to open source projects. Anytime you have a question, you can ask in many locations and get help right away (including from myself).
           </p>

<p>
            The course is designed to
            <strong>
             give you employable skills so you can get a job
            </strong>
            . Here is what one student recently wrote after taking the course and being hired right away:
            <br/>
<br/>
<em>
             ""I’m a self taught dev, who has been out of work for ~6 months. I had some family things that came up that prevented me from seeking permanent employment, so for awhile I was Postmates/Uber delivery driver.
             <br/>
<br/>
             After taking this course, I immediately got catapulted back to where I was before, but better equipped and with the knowledge to take on the next job. I had just finished the React section when I went to a recent interview, and it really helped me excel. As of today, I am officially re-employed back in the field, and it is all thanks to this course.I had a blast creating the final project, and FINALLY got around to learning SQL statements, and getting to use them in a project. I’m really ecstatic that Andrei went with teaching relational databases over something like MongoDB, which can also be fun, but is less practical for use on the job. So thanks Andrei, I really enjoyed the course and will be making sure to share it with others who find it helpful. I’m also looking forward to the new ES10 content that was recently added, and going through the DB stuff again when I go to build a personal project."" - J.C.

          This course is the accumulation of all of my years working in the industry, learning, and teaching. There is so much information out there, so many opinions, and so many ways of doing things, that unless you have spent the last few years working with these technologies in a company, you will never fully understand. So this course is the answer to thatexactproblem for you: How to gain experience when you need experience to get hired? I have gone through thousands of coding books, online tutorials and bootcamps.
          <strong>
           Throughout the years I have taken notes on what has worked and what hasn't, and I have created this course to narrow down the most efficient way to learn with the most relevant information.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
          I am 100% confident that you won't find a course like this out there. We're not going to be building simple todo applicationsand cat image sliders. We are going to learn actualpractical skills that will put you into the workforce. Some unique sections that you won't find anywhere else are:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             React.js + Redux:
            </strong>
            You will learn the library that companies like Netflix, Facebook and Instagram use to build fast, scalable applications.This is one of the highest in-demand skill in the industry.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             A day in the life of a developer:
            </strong>
            What will your day to day look like and what tools will youuse?I will take you through a sample day at a tech company.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             How does the internet actually work?What is the history of these technologies?:
            </strong>
            You will actually understand the underlying concepts of the internet, and how the technologies we have now, have come to be where they are.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             How do youactually deploy a real life app so that it is secure, and won't get hacked?:
            </strong>
            How does a real life app get out to the public in a safe and secure way?
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             What is Machine Learning and how you canharness its power:
            </strong>
            Whether you have heard about it or not, this is something that you will hear more and more in the coming years. Those who understand the high level concepts and can harness its power will have an advantage.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             What does your developer environment on your computer look like?:
            </strong>
            We will be setting up our computers with all the tools necessary of a developer so you can use the same setup when you go work in the industry.
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
          Why do we teach the above? Because in this day and age,
          <strong>
           just knowing HTML CSSand Javascript is not good enough, and you won't be able to grow in your role and command a higher salary. You will learn these things because these are the things you should know in 2023 so that you are miles ahead of the rest.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
          Make thisthe year that you took a risk, you learnedhighly in demand skills, you had new experiences, and you received new opportunities. I hope you join me in this journey.
          <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
           This is the proudest work I have ever done in my life and I am confident that you won't find a course better than this.

</p>
<p>
<br/>
          Andrei is the instructor of the
          <strong>
           highest rated Web Development course on Udemy as well as one of the fastest growing.
          </strong>
          His graduates have moved on to work for some of the biggest tech companies around the world like Apple, Google, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc... He has been working as a senior software developer in Silicon Valley and Toronto for many years, and is now taking all that he has learned, to teach programming skills and to help you discover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows in life.
         </p>
<p>
          Having been a self taught programmer, he understands that there is an overwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and books that are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills. Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp.
          <strong>
           Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education material should teach real life skills that are current and they should not waste a student's valuable time.
          </strong>
          Having learned important lessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to even founding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time to teaching others valuable software development skills in order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.
         </p>
<p>
          Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained.
          <strong>
           He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.

           What Other Students Are Saying About My CompTIA Security+ Course:
          </strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            I passed the Security+ exam. This course was absolutely essential to passing that exam. Only the Dion Security+ covered the topics comprehensively and thoroughly enough. No other resource I used came close. (Kolya, 5 stars)
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            I have just completed watching two different instructor corses on the same subject. I must say, Dion's has more information in a better constructed manner. This course is not easy, it is heavy with information and having you sit through shorter videos was the best part. Having watched more than just Dion's, I can say he goes over the content much better. Very glad I chose to watch a second course! (Rutger, 5 stars)
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            I love taking this wonderful course. It's full of important tips and amazing steps in order to pass CompTIA Security+. Thank you, Jason Dion, for making this incredible course! (Paul, 5 stars)

<br/>
<p>
          Javascript is the language of the web. So if you want to become a web developer, Javascript is a must learn language. This is an in-depth course which teaches seemingly difficult concepts like functional programming in a easy to understand way. Along the course, we also compare Javascript with other languages like Java, so that people having some experience with a language like C, Java or C#, which are statically typed languages, can easily understand how to write good Javascript programs.
         </p>
<p>
          Javascript has been notorious when it comes to finding bugs in the program. This course also talks about some pitfalls in the language which should be avoided, so that you have a much easier time writing code and debugging in this language.

           ""Thank you for the great opportunity to follow your course. For the past years I have followed a number of courses on public speaking worldwide in order to update myself on skills in public speaking. As a speech language pathologist and fluency specialist I train people who stutter become 'wow' speakers. I must say I am very successful and that is why I always want to keep updated on public speaking skills. I must say that your course is the most comprehensive and straight to the point course. The content is very much similar to the courses I deliver but I enjoyed your passion, enthusiasm and also expertise. As you know lol, those are the secrets of public speaking.

<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           1. Complete beginner to expert AI skills
          </strong>
          – Learn to code self-improving AI for a range of purposes. In fact, we code together with you. Every tutorial starts with a blank page and we write up the code from scratch. This way you can follow along and understand exactly how the code comes together and what each line means.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           2. Code templates –
          </strong>
          Plus, you’ll get downloadable Python code templates for every AI you build in the course. This makes building truly unique AI as simple as changing a few lines of code. If you unleash your imagination, the potential is unlimited.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           3. Intuition Tutorials –
          </strong>
          Where most courses simply bombard you with dense theory and set you on your way, we believe in developing a deep understanding for not only what you’re doing, but why you’re doing it. That’s why we don’t throw complex mathematics at you, but focus on building up your intuition in coding AI making for infinitely better results down the line.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           4. Real-world solutions –
          </strong>
          You’ll achieve your goal in not only 1 game but in 3. Each module is comprised of varying structures and difficulties, meaning you’ll be skilled enough to build AI adaptable to any environment in real life, rather than just passing a glorified memory “test and forget” like most other courses. Practice truly does make perfect.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           5. In-course support –
          </strong>
          We’re fully committed to making this the most accessible and results-driven AI course on the planet. This requires us to be there when you need our help. That’s why we’ve put together a team of professional Data Scientists to support you in your journey, meaning you’ll get a response from us within 48 hours maximum.

Unlock your camera's true potential!,"What you'll learn:
         </b>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
           Learn to use your camera in manual mode
          </li>
<li>
           Feel more confident shooting with a DSLR
          </li>
<li>
           Maximize the potential of your camera
          </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>
<strong>
           Why Take This Course?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          You have a DSLR Camera or a fancy Point-and-shoot, but have not been using it to it's full potential. You know that the scary ""manual mode"" holds a whole new level of customization which would result in better quality photos but have resisted. Terms like Shutter Speed and Aperture sound confusing and you don't know where to start.
         </p>
<p>
          If that sounds familiar, I want to assure you that by the end of my FREE course you will understand what those settings do and be on your way to controlling your camera rather than your camera controlling you.
         </p>
<p>
          You made an investment in a decent camera and it's time to start using it's features
         </p>
<p>
          In this course you will learn the basics of DSLR Photography and how to shoot in manual mode. My goal is to give you the tools so you can train your brain to think like a Photographer. You will also know how to control your camera instead of leaving it up to Auto Mode to try and to it's best.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           How Long Is This Course?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          So far, the course is just over 4 hours in length. You can watch it in chunks or all at once. It is best to watch it with camera in hand so you can pause and follow along with your camera. All DSLR Cameras are different so your settings may look different than mine.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           What Should I Expect?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          You should expect to be able to shoot photos with confidence in pretty much all situations. Whether you are taking pictures of your kids for the memories or are considering Photography as a profession, this is everything I had to teach myself in order to understand my camera.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Who are you Jerad Hill?
          </strong>

<p>
          I am aWedding Photographerwith over 6 years of professional experience. I have shot over 200 weddings, 120 engagement sessions, 150 portrait sessions and 1000's of photos of my own kids.

</p>
<p>
<strong>
           What this Special Edition Website Design course all about?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Website design is the art and science of building the look, feel, and how a website functions in a nutshell. This course is having clear, concise, and easy to use website design technologies and will ultimately lead to a better user experience for your custom audience or clients. There are many aspects of successful website design like HTML, colours, layouts, text size, graphics, and so much more. But, this course is a huge differentiator in the design field as it uses artificial intelligence-based website design state-of-the-art technologies that are covered nowhere in the world. If you've been wondering how to learn website design, you've come to the right place - after all.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why website design is needed for a successful online presence?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Having a good website is the backbone of every business and to achieve this successful feat, typically we need website design developers, content marketers, SEO specialists, etc. in an organization. But, some website design developers charge a lot of money outside in the market and other freelancing marketplaces to design websites using content management platforms like WordPress CMS. In fact, tools like Bookmark in website design will help advance your web-design career, altogether. This course is both a beginner's website design course and an advanced course for web developers.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Jobs in Website Design: Unveiled
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          According to Glassdoor, you can expect an average salary of $64,468 in the United States for doing website design. As your experience grows in website design all the time, you can expect to see higher salary ranges in the upcoming future. For example, you can expect an average Junior Website Designer to make around $62k in the United States alone and Rs. 2-3 Lakhs in India. As a Front End Website Design Developer, you can expect to make over $90k abroad.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Introduction to the website design course powered by Artificial Intelligence(AI) technology:
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          In the beginning website, design developers and designers designed websites using HTML. Soon, the internet was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep web, and the Spirit of Code was hovering over the pinnacle of utmost ignorance.
         </p>
<p>
          We’ve come a long way from that time. The internet is still a dark, dreadful place, but it’s much more stylish, sophisticated, and amazing now. Website Design has grown exponentially in scale and sophistication over the last few years, thanks to new Artificial Intelligence-based website creation tools that are dominating the digital marketing industry.
         </p>
<p>
          The technology is still in its infancy stage, however - but machine learning is enabling artificial design intelligence (ADI) to understand creative rules and apply them independently and in an intuitive and more attractive way - for that matter. Artificial design technology will soon be advanced enough to automate a lot of web design work in the near future too. New thought leaders would emerge and new courses like this would serve to be game-changers in the artificial intelligence-powered digital marketing space.

           logos
          </strong>
          and
          <strong>
           branding packages?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Are you intimidated by learning
          <strong>
           photoshop, illustrator or InDesign
          </strong>
          and want to learn through practical
          <strong>
           real worldprojects?
          </strong>
          Than This class will be for you!
         </p>
<p>
          We will extensively review
          <strong>
           Typography, color theory, layout and composition, how to use photos in design, photo manipulations and editing and magazine layout design
          </strong>
          ,
          <strong>
           branding and logo design
          </strong>
          just to name a few.
         </p>
<p>
          We also learn the basics of
          <strong>
           Adobe Photoshop, illustrator and InDesign
          </strong>
          and do projects with real world applications. Every designer needs to know and master these programs and this course makes sure you know the essential tools to power through amazing projects.
         </p>
<p>
          In
          <strong>
           Adobe Photoshop,
          </strong>
          we will review photo editing and manipulation techniques like how to cut objects out, duotones, changing color on objects, the liquify tool and we will create a compelling YouTube thumbnail with our newly learned photoshop skills as well as an entire book cover design project.
         </p>
<p>
          In
          <strong>
           Adobe Illustrator
          </strong>
          , we will master the pen tool by hand tracing simple and complex shapes. We will explore the power of the shape builder tool and In the end of this section, we will design a
          <strong>
           complete logo design
          </strong>
          . There is an entirely new introduction and tools section that has been added where we work through a
          <strong>
           7 page vector tracing worksheet
          </strong>
          and in the end create a complex vector illustration using our newly learned illustrator vector tools. Lastly, we will put together an
          <strong>
           event flyer
          </strong>
          to practice our layout skills, and even work through the
          <strong>
           branding process and create a logo
          </strong>
          , business card and letterhead for a business.
         </p>
<p>
          We will willcreate a magazine layout in
          <strong>
           InDesign

         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           We will talk about branding basics, what makes a good logo? How do you extend your logo or brand to other marketing materials?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          I designed this extensive course to be gentle enough for new comers to design but detailed enough for everyone to get a
          <strong>
           TON
          </strong>
          out of this course.

<strong>
           New Mini-Course Added!
           <br/>
           Discover YourDesignNiche!
          </strong>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>
           Do you want to find out what design niche you should concentrate on?
          </strong>
          This is an exploratory mini-class added to theGraphic DesignMasterclass course onUdemy (Section 15)that helps you find your next focus and explore many wonderful options for budding and established designers.
         </p>
<p>
          We are going to review some main core design categories and talk about what types of projects you will do and also what you will need to learn to leap into those design niches.
          <br/>
<br/>
          There are always more niches to discover but we will focus on the following in this mini-class:
          <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
           Logo Design
           <br/>
           Print &amp; Editorial Design
           <br/>
           Pattern Design and Illustration
           <br/>
           Package Design
           <br/>
           Branding Design
           <br/>
           UX/UI Design
           <br/>
           Social Media/Digital Graphic Designer
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          By the end of this class you will have a solid grasp of what each design niche entails. You will have confidence in choosing your top three focal niches to
          <strong>
           kickstart or enhance your design offerings and know what to learn next.

          </strong>
          and its most

           important feature
          </strong>
          (types!) to the point where you're able to
          <strong>
           use TypeScript in any of your projects
          </strong>
          .

          </strong>
          projects included!
         </p>
<p>
          AsTypeScript is developed by
          <strong>
           Microsoft
          </strong>
          and strongly advertised and used by
          <strong>
           Angular 2+ (Google) and other popular libraries
          </strong>
          , it's
          <strong>
           here to stay

</p>
<p>
          Learn how you can use TypeScript to bring modern JSfeatures like destructuring, arrow functions or classes to any environment and codebase - even if it does not support those features yet! Understand which types you may use and how you can build your own types. Learn how to write better code with types and with the many features offered by TypeScript!
         </p>
<p>
          But, in this course,
          <strong>
           we'll not stop after the basics
          </strong>
          ! You will also learn about more
          <strong>
           advanced features
          </strong>
          (like decorators)
          <strong>
</strong>
          and also how to set up
          <strong>
           workflows with TypeScript
          </strong>
          . This includes a TypeScript-only workflow as well as a
          <strong>
           webpack workflow
          </strong>
          .
         </p>
<p>
          You'll also learn that you're
          <strong>
           not limited to Angular
          </strong>
          or plain JavaScript/TypeScript projects. Instead, a complete module covers how you may
          <strong>
           use TypeScript with ReactJS
          </strong>
          and improve your React code with TypeScript as well.

<p>
<strong>
           Practice what you learn!
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Watching videos is a great way to learn. And to a lot of students, it's the best way. If you also want to practice the things you learn, this course offers you more than that though. Because this course comes with plenty of exercises (and solutions, of course) in addition to all the high-quality learning videos.

<strong>
           How important is database management in the age of big data and analytics?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          It is really important.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           How many employers would be happy to hire employees who can use data for the purposes of business intelligence?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          All of them.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           How many people have these skills?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Not enough.
         </p>
<p>
          This is why now is the time to learn SQL and gain a competitive advantage in the job market. Remember, the average salary of a SQL developer is $103,400! That’s a lucrative career.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           How come?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Well, when you can work with SQL, it means you don’t have to rely on others sending you data and executing queries for you. You can do that on your own. This allows you to be independent and dig deeper into the data to obtain the answers to questions that might improve the way your company does its business. For instance, Database management is the foundation for data analysis and intelligent decision making.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Worried that you have no previous experience?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Not an issue. We will start from the very basics and gradually teach you everything you need to know. Step by step. With no steps skipped.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why take this course in particular? Isn’t it like the rest of the SQL courses out there?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          We would like to think it isn’t. Our team worked hard to create a course that is:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            Easy to understand
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Time efficient and concise
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Shows how SQL can be crucial for data analytics and business intelligence
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            Comprehensive – it covers several topics not shown in other SQL courses
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            Practical – it teaches you how to work with a real-life database
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            Corresponds to professional best practices
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Taught in MySQL – The most popular SQL database management system
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            Contains plenty of downloadable exercises, course notes, and quiz questions
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
          Some of these aspects have been covered in other courses. Others haven’t. However, no one provides such a variety of topics in one place.
         </p>
<p>
          We firmly believe this course is the best training material out there. It is a truly interactive experience preparing you for a real-life working environment.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           We love teaching
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          So far, over 1,750,000 students have taken our courses here on Udemy. Teaching is what we do best, and we take pride in going the extra mile to create the most engaging content for you, our students. Our mission is to help you bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge taught at school and in universities and the practical application required at the workplace.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           So, why do you need to enroll in this course and learn SQL?
          </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Salary/Income.
            </strong>
            As we pointed out earlier, learning SQL is a great opportunity. There is a significant surge in demand for skills revolving around database management, database administration, and business analysis relying on data. Companies will pay top dollars for specialists who have such know-how
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Profession of the future.
            </strong>
            In the years to come, data will only grow in importance and size. Therefore, it is great to pick up a skill that will likely increase in demand over the years to come
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Analytical reasoning.
            </strong>
            Programming languages are a great way to train your mind. Furthermore, understanding a business task and looking for its solution through writing code can be really interesting and stimulating once you become familiar with the basics
           </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
           What about certificates? Do you provide a certificate?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Upon completion of the course, you will be able to download a certificate of completion with your name on it. Then, you can upload this certificate on LinkedIn and show potential employers this is a skill you possess.
         </p>
<p>
          Sounds awesome, right?

           <br/>
<br/>
           Please
          </strong>
          watch the presentation video
          <strong>
           BEFORE
          </strong>
          joining the course; If you don't like what you see (or my accent at the time of recording) please
          <strong>
           DONOT
          </strong>
          enroll. I've seen many people enrolling (since, you know, it's FREE) and then leaving negative scores because they didn't fancy the accent of the instructor or because the course was
          <strong>
           ""too basic""
          </strong>
          (even though it's basically written everywhere that this is a foundation course for absolute beginners).
          <br/>
          So, don't be
          <strong>
           that guy/girl,
          </strong>
          and join only if you believe this course is right for you. If you don't like how the course is structured or its content please do not hesitate to leave a negative score but in doing so add a comment explaining your reasons; This will help the instructor. A negative score without any comment or feedback is not useful to anyone and detrimental to other potential students.

           This course was made in 2015
          </strong>
          and, apart from a few tweaks in 2016it hasn't seen further updates (that is one of the reasons why it's now offered for free). So, you won't find things like CSSFlexbox/Grid here. Though, its content is still super relevant nowadays andimportant in building a solid foundation in Front-End Development.No matter what latest technology you want to learn, you need the basics first and this is

          Front End Development is an area of Web Development that includes all of the skills required to create the visual and interactive part of a Website. It's a complex mix of skills and technologies and one of the most fast growing and well paid IT sectors of the moment.
         </p>
<p>
          A Front End Developer is the link between the graphic designer, responsible for creating the visual design of a Web Application and the Backend Developer responsible for creating the computational logic behind the application. The Front End Developer brings the application to life creating rich, compelling experiences and allowing the user to interact with the data behind the application.

          <strong>
           Mac OSX
          </strong>
          machine; You can still benefit from this course if you're using Windows but you are required to have basic knowledge on how to use the Windows Explorer and create folders and files with it. You can easily avoid using the Windows command prompt (in the very rare videos that use the Terminal) and instead do what the video shows just using your WIndows Explorer (it's mostly creating folders and files).

          Having beena self taught programmer,he understands that there is anoverwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and booksthat are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills.Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp.
          <strong>
           Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education materialshould teach real life skills that are current andthey should not waste a student's valuable time.
          </strong>
          Having learned importantlessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to evenfounding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time toteaching others valuablesoftware development skillsin order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.
         </p>
<p>
          Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained.
          <strong>
           He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.

We are going to build a web scraper for HackerNews, build a Twitter bot, build the most secure password checker and we will also build some automation tools using Selenium. But the best part? We will build an actual portfolio website using Python that your future employer and customers can contact you at. By the end, you will have a stack of projects you have built that you can show off to others.
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
          Here’s the truth: Most courses teach you Python and do just that. They show you how to get started. But the thing is you don’t know where to go from there or how to build your own projects.
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
          Whether you are new to programming, or want to level up your Python skills, or are coming from a different programming language, this course is for you. This course is not about making you just code along without understanding the principles so that when you are done with the course you don’t know what to do other than watch another tutorial. No!
          <strong>
           This course will push you and challenge you to go from an absolute beginner with no coding experience to someone that can go off, forget about me, and build their own applications and get hired.

          AndreiNeagoie is the instructor of the
          <strong>
           highest rated Development courses on Udemy as well asone of the fastestgrowing.
          </strong>
          His graduates havemovedon to work forsome of the biggest techcompanies around the world like Apple, Google, Amazon, JP Morgan, IBM, UNIQLO etc...Hehasbeen working as a senior software developer inSilicon Valley and Toronto for many years,andis now taking all that he has learned,to teachprogramming skills andto help youdiscover the amazing career opportunities that being a developer allows inlife.
         </p>
<p>
          Having beena self taught programmer,he understands that there is anoverwhelming number of online courses, tutorials and booksthat are overly verbose and inadequate at teaching proper skills.Most people feel paralyzed and don't know where to start when learning a complex subject matter, or even worse, most people don't have $20,000 to spend on a coding bootcamp.
          <strong>
           Programming skills should be affordable and open to all. An education materialshould teach real life skills that are current andthey should not waste a student's valuable time.
          </strong>
          Having learned importantlessons from working for Fortune 500 companies, tech startups, to evenfounding his own business, he is now dedicating 100% of his time toteaching others valuablesoftware development skillsin order to take control of their life and work in an exciting industry with infinite possibilities.
         </p>
<p>
          Andrei promises you that there are no other courses out there as comprehensive and as well explained.
          <strong>
           He believes that in order to learn anything of value, you need to start with the foundation and develop the roots of the tree. Only from there will you be able to learn concepts and specific skills(leaves) that connect to the foundation. Learning becomes exponential when structured in this way.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Taking his experience in educational psychology and coding, Andrei's courses will take you on an understanding of complex subjects that you never thought would be possible.

<strong>
           Why should you take this course?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          So you saw that the course is absolutely full-packed with content. But maybe you're still not sure if you should actually learn advanced CSS?
         </p>
<p>
          That's probably because CSS is so easy to get started with. In fact, most developers highly underestimate the importance and power of CSS. But nothing could be further away from the truth!
         </p>
<p>
          CSS is what makes our design come to life. And there is so much we can do with it! Mastering advanced techniques like flexbox, CSS grid, and animations, will give you an edge over many CSS developers out there who still use outdated methods.
         </p>
<p>
          Plus, CSS can become a real nightmare when you try to master it, and when youhave to maintain large projects. So having a good grasp on fundamental concepts is an absolute must for any serious front-end developer.
         </p>
<p>
          And this course will help you with allthat!
         </p>
<p>
<em>
           So, should you take this course? The answer is most likely a big YES!
          </em>
</p>
<p>
          And I packed so much content into this course, that no matter if you're just starting out, or if you're already an experienced front-end developer, there is definitely gonna be something for you in this course.

<strong>
           Welcome to the Bootstrap &amp; jQuery – Certification Course for Beginners
           <br/>
<br/>
</strong>
          With over 64% of the world using mobile devices to browse web pages, it’s no surprise that Bootstrap and jQuery have become the industry leaders in front-end scripting languages.
          <br/>
<br/>
          This course starts right from the foundational concepts and gradually progresses to intermediate topics. Through a project-style learning approach, students will have the opportunity to build mobile-responsive web pages, complete with animation and interactivity.
          <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
           Bootstrap Section:
           <br/>
<br/>
</strong>
          Students are taught to use the Bootstrap framework for responsive, mobile-first - front-end development. As one of the leading open-source development libraries, Bootstrap is an essential part of the developers coding arsenal. The section begins with teaching students how to include essential Bootstrap files into web pages. It then explores the Bootstrap Grid system and popular layout strategies for optimal cross-device and cross-browser compatibility.
          <br/>
<br/>
          Students gain exposure to just about every Bootstrap component, from typography, tables and images, to jumbotrons, wells, alerts, buttons, glyphicons and progress bars. The section includes several hands-on exercises that will walk students through the process of creating stunning layouts, complete with modals, carousels, popovers, drop-down menus, forms and much more.
          <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
           jQuery Section:
           <br/>
<br/>
</strong>
          We explores the jQuery library and many of its unique features, used to create stunning, animated web pages. We start with the basics, from embedding jQuery into web pages to working with Selectors. Students then explore working with events, toggling, fading, sliding, and other forms of animation. The lessons also teach students how to work with callbacks, chaining, dragables, accordion menus and many other functions.

           <br/>
<br/>
</strong>
          This course offers a comprehensive guide into the fundamentals of coding using JavaScript and jQuery. These powerful languages can be used to add animated, dynamic client-side functionality to any web page.
          <br/>
<br/>
          The JavaScript section of the course takes students on a journey that starts right from the basics. This includes JavaScript placement, and embedding External JavaScript code. From there, we move into variable declaration and operators for performing arithmetic. We also look at the order of operations, and different data types. Students then move into more advanced topics such as:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            JavaScript Objects
           </p>

          The second section of the course takes an in-depth look into jQuery. This is where students can take their development skills to the next level, by adding interactivity to static elements. We start with foundational concepts such as embedding jQuery, and various selectors. We then explore jQuery events, Animations, complex functions, and much more.

<p>
          As a computer science teacher, I noticed that IP addressing was one of the most intimidating topics for my students, and yet, it's so simple for those who truly get to understand it.
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
          My goal here was to create a course that is as simple as possible, and therefore, easy to understand for everyone, including those who are just beginning their journey into computer networks. One thing I added (that I haven't seen in the other courses) is summarization - this topic may not be interesting to beginners, but if you plan on getting familiar with advanced routing techniques, you may want to practice summarization.

          Durante esse anos emque tive a oportunidade de oferecer cursose suporte na plataformaWordPress, percebi que a maioria das pessoasdesistemde criar seus sites antes mesmo da instalação,provavelmente devido aos conceitos mais técnicoscomo registro de domínio, servidores, FTP e banco de dados que antecedem essa etapa.
         </p>
<p>
          Por conta disso decidi criar o curso WordPress Expresso, onde você irá aprender aconstruiros seus próprios sites emWordPressde umaforma simples e rápida utilizando o servidor da Umbler.

           #3 The actual instructor answers ALL QUESTIONS. The unfortunate truth is that on Udemy
          </strong>
          most instructors do not answer questions at all even though Udemy provides a spot in the course for that. How disappointing. Other instructors have a ""Team"" that is really a low cost outsource provider who answers questions and provides general 1 or 2 sentence answers, if that. What a rip off. The instructor in this course answers all questions with detailed responses and provides supplemental links and resources to support the answer. Many students like to go though and read the Q&amp;A and consider it like a blog that really aids learning on its own.

Linux for Network Engineers: Practical Linux with GNS3,4.7,4338,Udemy,David Bombal and Experts with David Bombal,https://www.classcentral.com/course/udemy-linux-for-network-engineers-practical-linux-23987/visit,/provider/udemy,"['Udemy', 'Paid Course', 'English', 'Certificate Available', '13 hours worth of material', 'On-Demand', 'Beginner', 'English']","Linux for Networking Engineers (CCNA, CCNP, CCIE etc). Practical Linux with GNS3 = network programmability & automation","What you'll learn:
         </b>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
           Learn foundational Linux skills
          </li>
<li>
           Learn how to practically use Linux in your networks
          </li>
<li>
           Build Linux networks using GNS3
          </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>
          It is important for you as a network engineer to learn Linux!
         </p>
<p>
          Why? There are many reasons including:
         </p>
<p>
          1) A lot of network operating systems are based on Linux, or have a Linux shell you can access, or use Linux type commands. I'll show you an example using Cisco, Arista and Cumulus Linux.
         </p>
<p>
          2) Network Automation tools such as Ansible don't run the command node on Windows. You are probably going to use Linux with tools such as Ansible, Netmkio, NAPALM and other network automation tools.
         </p>
<p>
          3) SDN controllers such as OpenDaylight, ONOS, RYU and APIC-EM run on Linux.You will find that many SDN tools require Linux.
         </p>
<p>
          4) DevOps tools such as git work best with Linux.
         </p>
<p>
          5) IoT devices typically run Linux
         </p>
<p>
          6) A new breed of network devices from companies like Facebook, Microsoft and Cumulus Linux use Linux.
         </p>
<p>
          There are even more reasons, but make sure you don't get left behind! You as a network engineer start learning Linux.
         </p>
<p>
          This course teaches foundational Linux knowledge without assuming that you have any Linux experience. Learn practically with GNS3!
         </p>
<p>
          Learn how to configure Linux networking, how to create users and assign permissions, how to install and run Linux services such as DNS and DHCP.
         </p>
<p>
          The course uses various GNS3 topologies with devices such as:
         </p>
<p>
          1) Linux Docker containers
         </p>
<p>
          2) Linux GNS3 QEMU virtual machines
         </p>
<p>
          3) Traditional Linux virtual mahcines
         </p>
<p>
          4) Network devices - you could use Cisco, Arista, Cumulus Linux or others
         </p>

          Do you want to see something else added to the course? Just let me know. I like to get your feedback on ways I can improve the course and add more content that you think is relevant.
         </p>
<p>
          Networking is changing. Make sure you keep up to date!

           Course for General and Academic
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          You just need to look at the section HEADINGS and they state if the section is Academic or General.
         </p>
<p>
          The way it basically works is like this.
         </p>
<p>
          1. There is a section labeled ACADEMIC READING.
         </p>
<p>
          2. After those sections you will find the specific sections labeled GENERALREADING.
         </p>
<p>
          3. The Listening section is for both sections.
         </p>
<p>
          4. After the Academic Task 1 Writing sections, you will find the sections with the heading Task 1 General Letter
         </p>
<p>
          5. Writing Task 2 is the same for both
         </p>
<p>
          6. Speaking is the same for both
         </p>

          “Through my Agile journey, this is one of the top courses I have taken. Why? I enjoy this course because it goes over a large scheme of topics that are specific and useful, but also given to the learner in bite sized pieces.. This course is especially helpful if you are working in an Agile Team or looking to implement Agile into a team. I have a much clearer understanding on the ceremonies, structure of a team, team responsibilities and reasoning behind different pieces of software, such as Jira. I have gained a lot of knowledge from the course, quizzes, and activities that Jeremy and Vivek put together. I can absolutely see myself implementing what I have gained from this course into my team and future teams. Thanks for creating an easy to follow course!!”

          Javascript is the language that modern developers need to know, and know well. Truly knowing Javascript will get you a job, and enable you to build quality web and server applications.
         </p>
<p>
<em>
           NOTE: This course includes information on ECMAScript 6 (ES6) the next version of Javascript!
          </em>
</p>
<p>
          In this course you will gain a deep understanding of Javascript,
          <strong>
           learn how Javascript works under the hood
          </strong>
          , and how that knowledge helps you avoid common pitfalls and
          <em>
<strong>
            drastically improve your ability to debug problems
           </strong>
</em>
          . You will find clarity in the parts that others, even experienced coders, may find weird, odd, and at times incomprehensible. You'll learn the beauty and deceptive power of this language that is at the forefront of modern software development today.
         </p>
<p>
          This course will cover such advanced concepts as
          <strong>
           objects and object literals, function expressions, prototypical inheritance, functional programming, scope chains, function constructors (plus new ES6 features), immediately invoked function expressions (IIFEs), call, apply, bind, and more
          </strong>
          .
         </p>
<p>
          We'll take
          <strong>
           a deep dive into the source code of popular frameworks
          </strong>
          such as jQuery and Underscore to see how you can use your understanding of Javascript to learn (and borrow) from other's good code.
         </p>
<p>
          Finally, you'll learn the foundations of how to
          <strong>
           build your own Javascript framework or library
          </strong>
          .
          <br/>
</p>
<p>
          What you'll learn in this course will
          <strong>
           make you a better Javascript developer, and improve your abilities in AngularJS, NodeJS, jQuery, React, Ember, MongoDB, and all other Javascript-based technologies!

         </b>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
           Take control of their mindset and energy levels to increase your productivity
          </li>
<li>
           Discover why you are not as productive as you could be and develop a plan to improve
          </li>
<li>
           Increase  your productivity by implementing new strategies throughout your day
          </li>
<li>
           Create a personal plan that fits your personality and style
          </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>
          If you have more things to do than you have time and frequently get overwhelmed with all your priorities and tasks, you are in the right place! I designed this course to help people from all walks of life that struggle with trying to get it all done.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
          At the same time I have done my best to design this course as efficiently as possible since time is our most precious resource.
         </p>
<p>
          This course is going to be focused into three areas or sections. Each is designed to build on the other, but each lecture is labeled by concept clearly, so you will also be able to come back and hit specific topics that are most helpful for you.
          <br/>
</p>
<p>
          In our first section we are going to focus on what is causing our overwhelm and what leads us to procrastination.
          <br/>
</p>
<p>
          In our second section, we build the foundation for a new level of productivity and cover the fundamentals and key concepts that must be mastered in order to really get the results you want and to be a master of productivity. If you don’t start with the right fundamentals, even the best tricks and hacks won’t be fully utilized.
          <br/>
</p>
<p>
          And finally in our last section we will build on the foundation we created by implementing proven productivity and time management tactics and strategies to really make a dramatic improvement in your productivity.
          <br/>
</p>
<p>
          Here is what some of my students have to say about the course.

Launch!","What you'll learn:
         </b>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
           Launch a Live Website Landing Page
          </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>
          Remember when you couldn't walk? Of course not. Who can?
         </p>
<p>
          Learning to code is much like learning to walk...except it happens much later in life.
         </p>
         Never coded before? No problem.
         <p>
          Entrepreneurs like you are a rare breed. You create incredible businesses and come up with ideas that change the world.
         </p>
<p>
          Technology has made the 21st century, the century of the entrepreneur. Thanks to the power of the internet, you can reach a global audience in minutes.
         </p>
<p>
          The question is...do you have the skills to be able to take advantage of this incredible opportunity?
         </p>
<p>
          If you're starting (or have started) a business in today's tech driven economy, then you've got to understand the code that's driving your business.
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Imagine asking others to create your software but you've no idea how it works?
          </li>
<li>
           Imagine not knowing the time and effort involved in realizing your idea?
          </li>
<li>
           Imagine having an incredible idea but you don't have the skills to get it started?
          </li>
</ul>
         I'm Not Going To Teach You Tons of Coding Languages...
         <p>
          Instead of spending infinity boring you with the intricacies of a multitude of languages, Coding For Entrepreneurs will teach you the exact languages you need to know to launch any type of eCommerce site &amp; build landing pages that convert browsers into buyers.
         </p>
<p>
          The
          <strong>
           best way to learn is by doing
          </strong>
          - you'll never learn anything if you sit and watch videos or read a PDF all day. We get you into action and enable you to achieve results immediately.
         </p>
<p>
          You'll get in introduction in:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           Python
          </li>
<li>
           Django
          </li>
<li>
           HTML
          </li>
<li>
           CSS
          </li>
</ul>
         Don't worry if these look scary...if you can multiply and add numbers then you can code!
         <p>
          Coding is extremely logical. Take Python for example - it reads just like the English language less a couple of odd characters.
         </p>
<p>
          We Put Special Emphasis On Django...Why?
          <br/>
</p>
<strong>
          - Django is based in Python
         </strong>
<br/>
         - It's fast, simple, effective, secure, and ideal for ""perfectionists with deadlines""
         <br/>
<strong>
          - Built-In User Login (authentication) System
         </strong>
<br/>
         - Web-based Admin system (built - in)
         <br/>
<strong>
          - Template system that allows basic knowledge of HTML/CSS to design the front-end.
         </strong>
<br/>
         - Growing Community for Help/Advice/Best Practices .... and freelance clients (or jobs).
         <br/>
<strong>
          - Easy to implement &amp; Launch
         </strong>
<br/>
         But I've Been Told That I Need To Learn C, C#, Objective C and Java?
         <p>
          The truth is that you could learn all of these languages and use them to further enhance your coding.
         </p>
<p>
          But why bother?
         </p>
<p>
          You're an entrepreneur, NOT a professional coder. Would you rather learn how to code something quickly and start building your business empire or spend years debugging something that may never launch?
         </p>
<p>
          It's time to take your future into your own hands and learn how to start Coding For Entrepreneurs today!

          ""The easiest way to take this course in terms of learning is through a Linux VM. On Windows, download Virtualbox and a Linux .iso (e.g. Ubuntu). Once downloaded, open Virtualbox, follow the steps to create a Ubuntu VM, select the .iso from your hard drive, install Ubuntu and you're good to go with all the commands mentioned in this course. The only extra command I've had so far to install pip is 'sudo apt-get install python-setuptools'."" -- Harry (student)

         </p>
<p>
          React Native is an excellent solution for developing apps on mobile in a fraction of the time it takes to make an equivalent iOS or Swift app. You'll love seeing your changes instantly appear on your own device, rather than waiting for Swift/Java code to recompile! This quick feedback loop, along with excellent cross platform support, is what has catapulted React Native to the top must-have skill for Javascript engineers.

          If you are new to React, or if you've been working to learn it but sometimes feel like you still don't quite 'get it', this is the React course for you! To learn React you have to understand it.

          Hey,
          <strong>
           Mike Meyers here. The Team at Total Seminars
          </strong>
          and I are excited to bring you this video series to help you pass the
          <strong>
           CompTIA A+ Certification Core 1 (220-1001) exam.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Between my bestselling A+, Network+, and Security+ books and my video courses, I've taught
          <strong>
           over 2 million people
          </strong>
          how to take and pass these CompTIA IT industry certification exams. I've got an easy-going, approachable, and funny teaching style that has helped newbies and experienced techs alike learn valuable IT skills. I've taught in-person seminars for the DEA and the FBI, and now I'm going to teach you,
         </p>
<p>
          Total Seminars is the
          <strong>
           #1 name in CompTIA Certification training for over 25 years
          </strong>
          . We've taught more students than there are CompTIA certified techs (not everyone takes the exams). We can prepare you to take and
          <strong>
           pass the exam and make you a better IT tech in the process.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
          This is the
          <strong>
           first of a two-course series
          </strong>
          and is designed to prepare you to take and pass the CompTIA A+ 2019 Core 1 (220-1001) exam. It's an internationally-recognized, fundamental IT training certification. Not interested in certification? No problem! Even if you just want to learn about the basics of IT and computers, I've got you covered.
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            Course 1: TOTAL: CompTIA A+ Certification (220-1001). (this course)

          “[Mike] Meyers is amazing when it comes to explaining. His fun little bits, such as when he explains common problems and how to troubleshoot them, keep you engaged and help it stick so much better. I went from barely understanding little bits here and there to passing the 1001 on my first try with the help of this course. …If you have tried reading the books and listening to lectures from people who sound like the teacher from Ferris Bueller then I would highly recommend this course paired with his practice tests.” – Robert F.

Whatever your motivation, this course is perfect to help give you a robust IT foundational knowledge in a way that's easy-to-understand. And, hopefully, you'll have a few laughs with me along the way.

           Why Learn from Me
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          In this course,
          <strong>
           you won’t just gain the book smarts to pass the exam. You’ll also hone your hands-on skills to succeed as a network engineer in the real world.
          </strong>
          I’m a professional instructor who has been entrusted by Cisco since 2007 to develop and deliver training courses for their own engineers and partners. I’ve also designed multiple training courses for the largest service providers in the Asia Pacific region such as IBM, Verizon, and the Australian National Broadband Network. I’ve spent years distilling my decade’s worth of networking experience from the field into mentoring and supporting other systems engineers, and I’m passionate about passing my knowledge of Cisco networks onto others.
         </p>
<p>
          As a student in this course, you’ll get lifetime access to the course materials and answers to every question you ask in the Q&amp;A board. I love interacting with my students: anything you want to know, please ask. The course also comes with an unconditional risk-free 30 day money-back guarantee–that's my personal promise of your success.
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           Value
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           If you take a comparable course at a training centre it will cost you thousands of dollars,
          </strong>
          and when it’s over you can’t experience the tutorials again or ask the instructor any more questions. When you take my course you can learn anytime you want in the comfort of your own home, and I’m always here for you whenever you need any help.
         </p>
<p>
          Not sure about the best way to pay for this course? Ask your manager at work if they’ll expense it. They won’t have to pay the large fees of traditional classroom learning or have to cover your absence for a week. They get
          <strong>
           huge value from this investment in your future.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          When you’re done with the course, you’ll have everything you need to crush the Cisco CCNA exam. I’m excited to share all of my knowledge with you.
         </p>

<strong>
           Learn from Google or from this Course?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          I've been there! I first learnt VBA from Google.
         </p>
<p>
          It was truly a light-bulb moment, when I realized that Google has some answers - it could give me some of the code I was looking for - but there two things missing:
         </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<em>
             The WHY
            </em>
            - why does the code work in one situation but not another.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>
             Structure
            </em>
            - topic sequence, real-case examples, workbooks, documentation.
           </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>
           Don’t waste your time
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Don't waste your time on poor quality videos and confusing explanations. In this ExcelVBA course,complex topics are taught in a simple way by an instructor with 17 years of experience. The contenthas been carefully crafted and clearly organized.The videos are high quality andincludeanimations to emphasize points. Most importantlyyou learn VBAbydoing.

           ""I have already tried some VBA classes but so far I was never able to apply what I learnt to my own work. This course is different. I have already used some of the techniques Leila is teaching and applied it to my work files. I was able to reduce manual work for me and my colleagues by creating my own macros from scratch. Highly recommended!!!""

<em>
           ""Leila is the real deal... there are many VBA courses on Udemy (some of which I've taken) that merely demonstrate the functionalities. Leila explains the important foundation concepts and how the model is set up allowing you to truly create VBA code from thought rather than copying and pasting from various places. Her class is professionally constructed, with resources and content for each lecture, practice content for you to try things yourself and good Q&amp;A opportunities to answer specific questions. Trust me, this is the course you want to take.""

           ABOUT INSTRUCTOR(S)
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          We are a group of Hadoop consultants who are passionate about Hadoop and Big Data technologies. 4 years ago when we were looking for Big Data consultants to work in our own projects we did not find qualified candidates because the big data industry was very new and hence we set out to train qualified candidates in Big Data ourselves giving them a deep and real world insights in to Hadoop.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           WHAT YOU WILL LEARN IN THIS COURSE
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          In the first section you will learn about what is big data with examples. We will discuss the factors to consider when considering whether a problem is big data problem or not. We will talk about the challenges with existing technologies when it comes to big data computation. We will breakdown the Big Data problem in terms of storage and computation and understand how Hadoop approaches the problem and provide a solution to the problem.
         </p>
<p>
          In the HDFS, section you will learn about the need for another file system like HDFS. We will compare HDFS with traditional file systems and its benefits. We will also work with HDFS and discuss the architecture of HDFS.
         </p>
<p>
          In the MapReduce section you will learn about the basics of MapReduce and phases involved in MapReduce. We will go over each phase in detail and understand what happens in each phase. Then we will write a MapReduce program in Java to calculate the maximum closing price for stock symbols from a stock dataset.
         </p>
<p>
          In the next two sections, we will introduce you to Apache Pig &amp; Hive. We will try to calculate the maximum closing price for stock symbols from a stock dataset using Pig and Hive.

          Hi there! My name is Dan &amp; I’m an Adobe Certified Instructor. I’m here to help you learn Adobe XD efficiently and comprehensively. XD is a fantastic design tool used by industry professionals to product high quality &amp; functional mockups. By the end of this course, you will be able to produce practical and effective User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) designs.
         </p>
<p>
          Throughout the course I’ll invite you to participate in a real-life freelance project which I’m working on. It’s a project that requires a fresh website and mobile app interface. This will prepare you for dealing with real world projects if you choose to move towards a UX/UI career path.

             ""This course is definitely above expectations so far. I didn't expect to get so much insight into the briefing and the communication between UX Designer and a client. It helps to see the brief and to learn that there are different tiers of income based on projects and experience. Love It!""
            </em>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
          This course is aimed at people interested in UI/UX Design. We’ll start from the very beginning and work all the way through, step by step. If you already have some UI/UX Design experience but want to get up to speed using Adobe XD then this course is perfect for you too!
         </p>
<p>
          First, we will go over the differences between UX and UI Design. We will look at what our brief for this real-world project is, then we will learn about low-fidelity wireframes and how to make use of existing UI design kits.
         </p>
<p>
          I’ll go over all of the essential tools necessary for creating excellent wireframes, including: type, colours, icons, Lorem ipsum, artboards, prototyping, models and popups, symbols and repeat grids. We will even make use of the new prototyping app so that you can experience your prototype on your mobile device.

             Excellent course - Dan is an excellent teacher and I thoroughly enjoyed following along with his videos. Highly recommend! July 2018: I have updated this review with an extra star because of how useful this course has been in the months following it's completion. I am using Adobe XD daily and Dan's instruction was instrumental to adding this feather to my front-end web development hat.
            </em>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
          An important part of maximising your UX Design workflow is being able to utilise other software such as Photoshop and Illustrator. This is why I’ll be teaching you how to make use of both to help boost your XD productivity.
         </p>
<p>
          One of the awesome new features of XD is micro-interactions. I’ll be teaching you all about those and how to use them to grow icons and scenes. This is one of the parts of web design that’s growing and being adopted rapidly so you won’t want to miss out on learning it early.

          It is no secret that a lot of these topics have been explained online. Thousands of times. However, it is next to impossible to find a structured program that gives you an understanding of why certain statistical tests are being used so often. Modern software packages and programming languages are automating most of these activities, but this course gives you something more valuable – critical thinking abilities. Computers and programming languages are like ships at sea. They are fine vessels that will carry you to the desired destination, but it is up to you, the aspiring data scientist or BI analyst, to navigate and point them in the right direction.

           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Effective Notekeeping.
            </strong>
            An ethical hacker is only as good as the notes he or she keeps. We will discuss the important tools you can use to keep notes and be successful in the course and in the field.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Networking Refresher.
            </strong>
            This section focuses on the concepts of computer networking. We will discuss common ports and protocols, the OSI model, subnetting, and even walk through a network build with using Cisco CLI.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Introductory Linux.
            </strong>
            Every good ethical hacker knows their way around Linux. This section will introduce you to the basics of Linux and ramp up into building out Bash scripts to automate tasks as the course develops.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Introductory Python.
            </strong>
            Most ethical hackers are proficient in a programming language. This section will introduce you to one of the most commonly used languages among ethical hackers, Python. You'll learn the ins and outs of Python 3 and by the end, you'll be building your own port scanner and writing exploits in Python.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Hacking Methodology.
            </strong>
            This section overviews the five stages of hacking, which we will dive deeper into as the course progresses.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Reconnaissance and Information Gathering.
            </strong>
            You'll learn how to dig up information on a client using open source intelligence. Better yet, you'll learn how to extract breached credentials from databases to perform credential stuffing attacks, hunt down subdomains during client engagements, and gather information with Burp Suite.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Scanning and Enumeration.
            </strong>
            One of the most important topics in ethical hacking is the art of enumeration. You'll learn how to hunt down open ports, research for potential vulnerabilities, and learn an assortment of tools needed to perform quality enumeration.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Exploitation Basics.
            </strong>
            Here, you'll exploit your first machine! We'll learn how to use Metasploit to gain access to machines, how to perform manual exploitation using coding, perform brute force and password spraying attacks, and much more.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Mid-Course Capstone.
            </strong>
            This section takes everything you have learned so far and challenges you with 10 vulnerable boxes that order in increasing difficulty. You'll learn how an attacker thinks and learn new tools and thought processes along the way. Do you have what it takes?
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Exploit Development.
            </strong>
            This section discusses the topics of buffer overflows. You will manually write your own code to exploit a vulnerable program and dive deep into registers to understand how overflows work. This section includes custom script writing with Python 3.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Active Directory.
            </strong>
            Did you know that 95% of the Fortune 1000 companies run Active Directory in their environments? Due to this, Active Directory penetration testing is one of the most important topics you should learn and one of the least taught. The Active Directory portion of the course focuses on several topics. You will build out your own Active Directory lab and learn how to exploit it. Attacks include, but are not limited to:
            <strong>
             LLMNR poisoning, SMB relays, IPv6 DNS takeovers, pass-the-hash/pass-the-password, token impersonation, kerberoasting, GPP attacks, golden ticket attacks,
            </strong>
            and
            <strong>
             much more.
            </strong>
            You'll also learn important tools like
            <strong>
             mimikatz, Bloodhound,
            </strong>

          I am a self-taught programmer. After a year of self-study, I learned to program well enough to land a job as a software engineer II at eBay. Once I got there, I realized I was severely under-prepared. I was overwhelmed bythe amount ofthings I needed to know but hadn't learned yet. My journey learning to program, and my experience at my first job as a software engineer were the inspiration for this course.

<p>
          This course is not just about learning to program; although you will learn to code. If you want to program professionally, it is not enough to learn to code; that is why, in addition to helping you learn to program, I also cover the rest of the things you need to know to program professionally that classes and books don't teach you. The Self-taught Programmer is a roadmap, a guide to take you from writing your first Python program, to passing your first technical interview. I divided the course into five sections:

<p>
          This video / videography course starts from the beginning, which is about coming up with great video ideas. You'll learn what makes a video great, and how to come up with video topics for your target audience. You'll walk through the pre-production process to ensure a smooth video shoot.

14-day English language fluency course,4.5,8163,Udemy,Joel South,https://www.classcentral.com/course/udemy-14-day-english-language-fluency-course-27558/visit,/provider/udemy,"['Udemy', 'Free Online Course', 'English', '2-3 hours worth of material', 'On-Demand', 'Intermediate', 'English']",You will improve your spoken English in just 2 weeks!,"What you'll learn:
         </b>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
           Be able to speak fluently about 14 common topics.
          </li>
<li>
           Learn more than 100 new words.
          </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>
<strong>
           Are you struggling to speak English?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Have you spent hours learning new words, studying grammar, watching English movies, listening to English music and now you wonder why you can’t use all of this knowledge in a conversation?
         </p>
<p>
          Well, here’s your answer!
         </p>
<p>
          Speaking English is a skill- just like swimming. Can you learn swimming from a book? No. How about from a movie? No, again. You need to get into the pool and start doing the action. Speaking, like swimming, is an action.
         </p>
<p>
          So, the ONLY way to improve your spoken English is to speak.
         </p>
<p>
          That’s where this course helps you!
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           How does this course work?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          I have divided this course into 14 days. Each day has a new topic and each topic is divided into
          <strong>
           4 short videos
          </strong>
          .
         </p>
<p>
          The
          <strong>
           first video
          </strong>
          will introduce 8 words or terms. In this video I will explain the meaning of these words and provide an example of how it can be used in a sentence. At the end, we will review the vocabulary.
         </p>
<p>
          In the
          <strong>
           second video
          </strong>
          I provide an example speech of the topic. In this video I use the words from video 1 to make a speech. This allows you to see me using the vocabulary.
         </p>
<p>
          The
          <strong>
           third
          </strong>
          video is the most important video. In this video I give you a chance to make a speech using the vocabulary of the topic. But there is one rule:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
           You can’t say: umm, ahh, enn or any other vocal-filled pause or interjection.
          </li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>
           Why?
          </em>
</p>
<p>
          Well, this is a fluency course. If you always need to stop and think about what to say next, then you’re not speaking fluently. If you do break the rule, simply stop and start your speech again.
         </p>
<p>
          The
          <strong>
           final video
          </strong>
          is a dictation test. Listen to me say the words from the topic and write them down. Then, compare your spelling with the actual spelling of the words.
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           Can I really improve my spoken English with this course?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          I believe you can. I have used this method with literally hundreds of students and have seen my students’ speaking ability improve dramatically.
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why should I choose this course over other courses?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>
            Price.
           </strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
          Firstly, it’s free (for the moment) so you have nothing to lose.
         </p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>
            Enthusiastic teacher.
           </strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
          Secondly, I think I teach this course in an enthusiastic way and hope that this enthusiasm spreads to you. I believe that if you want to learn anything, you must be enthusiastic or you will simply give up.
         </p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>
            There is a finish line that you can see.
           </strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
          By knowing that this course is only 14 days, I hope that it provides you with the feeling that it is short sprint and not a marathon.
         </p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>
            Consistency is key (or king).
           </strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
          It’s much more effective to study a few minutes a day than to study for a few hours once or twice a week. I want English to be your hobby that you enjoy not your habit that you hate. By only studying for a few minutes a day (but doing it every day) it is less likely that you will come to hate learning.
         </p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>
            Remember what you learn.
           </strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
          I believe that quality is more important than quantity. My rule as an ESL/EFL teacher is to teach between 5 to 10 words per 1-hour class. This is because how many words you study is not important. Only how many words you can use is the number that we should care about. I see many students trying to remember 30 or even 50 words a day! But, the sad thing is the next day they may only remember 4 or 5. I will teach you vocabulary in a way that allows you to retain the vocabulary that you learn.
         </p>
<p>
<em>
<strong>
            Develop a habit for learning.
           </strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
          Finally, many people say that it takes 2 weeks to develop a habit. I hope this course will provide you with the framework to develop a habit of study. While this is my only course (at the moment) here on Udemy, there are many other fantastic courses on here to study. I hope that you can use this course as a stepping stone for your continued growth.
         </p>

          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          So, if you want to learn to speak English more fluently whilst getting your hands on some useful vocabulary, then why not try my 14-day English language fluency course? You have nothing to lose and you will be very glad you did.
         </p>

          Let’s be honest it’s the main reason we work in the first place. So, you’ll be happy to hear that a typical Business Analyst (BA) earns over $78,000 per year. And that is only the average.

</p>
<p>
          NGINX is now considered the most powerful, efficient, and secure web server technology used to host web applications of all sizes and complexity. The software is open-source, and is designed for maximum performance and stability. It also aims to correct many of the short-falls of Apache, when it comes to delivering content to your end user. NGINX can be used for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and much more.

</p>
<p>
          This section of the course offers an in-depth look into the role of SSL certificates when it comes to server security and web traffic encryption. We start with a thorough introduction which includes exploring different types of certificates and how they work. From there, students create a droplet on Digital Ocean and configure their own free SSL certificate using Let’s Encrypt Certificate Authority. This section of the course combines theoretical and hands-on training. Students have the opportunity to practice some of the concepts explored in the previous two sections, while also learning about free SSL Certificates, such as Let’s Encrypt.

           SOLID Principles

<li>
           Clean Code Design in OOP
          </li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>
          From this course, you can learn
          <strong>
           Object-Oriented Programming from basics to advanced concepts.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          All code examples in the course are written in Java but that's doesn't mean you can't apply the knowledge from this course in other programming languages. You can easily use the knowledge from this course in any language if you want to build applications with the help of an object-oriented programming approach.
         </p>
<p>
          There are a lot of other courses on this topic.
          <strong>
           So, why would you choose exactly this course?
          </strong>
          Here are just a few reasons:
          <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
           - Coding exercises
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          To learn to program is not enough just watching videos and reading books. You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will have different practical tasks which will help you learn and understand Java better.
         </p>
<p>
          One of the key tasks where you can practice your knowledge is the implementation of a backend system for an online store. Also, you have a lot of tasks that use domain-specific terminology:accounts, transactions, users, carts, menu, services, etc. So that means you are learning programming without abstract concepts like it is written in the books or in other courses. You learn domain-specific terminology and during the lessons, we investigate specific extracts from code that can give you a clear vision of how you can apply the knowledge in real life.
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
<strong>
           - Open source code
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          We hide nothing from our students!Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.
         </p>
<p>
          You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.
          <br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           - Q&amp;A support
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer.
          <br/>
          In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
            So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?:)), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course.
           </em>
</strong>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>
           - Relevant knowledge
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!
         </p>
<p>
          The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IToutsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTWmost of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha.
         </p>
<p>
          With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best ITconsultants in the world.
          <br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           - Free mobile App without limits for our students
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes.
         </p>
<p>
          In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREEmobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms)
         </p>
<p>
          The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview.
         </p>
<p>
          Also,
          <strong>
<em>
            only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification.
           </em>
</strong>
          In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.
          <br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           - High concentration of useful material in each lesson
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson.
         </p>
<p>
          This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes
          <strong>
<em>
            10 times as much (sometimes even 20)
           </em>
</strong>
          as the final lesson duration after video editing.
         </p>
<p>
          Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered.
         </p>

          ""Angela is literally my favorite teacher. Ever. In the entire universe. She is hilarious and teaches in a lighthearted and fun way that is also very clear to understand. I instantly purchased this course as soon as I saw it was released because I know Angela delivers the highest quality educational content possible. 100% recommend this course (as well as every other course she's created). Thank you Angela for helping me as I make a career pivot into becoming a hybrid UX designer/mobile developer!"" - Jacob Pernell
         </p>
<p>
          ""Angela is my favorite Udemy professor for coding courses. Her methods for building onto the material so that you're never progressing too fast or too slow make for a really engaging learning experience. She's thorough in her explanations, and uses fun projects to discuss the material. I had started a couple other Flutter courses before finding this one, and I've progressed more in 24hrs than I did in a week with the other courses. Would love an advanced Flutter course from Angela to tackle once I'm done with this one!"" - Jerome Llouche

          Spark and Hadoop developers are hugely valued at companies with large amounts of data; these are very marketable skills to learn.
         </p>
<p>
          Almost every large company you might want to work at uses Hadoop in some way, including Amazon, Ebay, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, IBM, Spotify, Twitter, and Yahoo! And it's not just technology companies that need Hadoop; even the New YorkTimes uses Hadoop for processing images.
         </p>
<p>
          This course is comprehensive, covering
          <strong>
           over 25 different technologies
          </strong>
          in over
          <strong>
           14hours of video lectures
          </strong>
          . It's filled with hands-on activities and exercises, so you get some real experience in using Hadoop - it's not just theory.
         </p>
<p>
          You'll find a range of activities in this course for people at every level. If you're a project manager who just wants to learn the buzzwords, there are web UI's for many of the activities in the course that require no programming knowledge. If you're comfortable with command lines, we'll show you how to work with them too. And if you're a programmer, I'll challenge you with writing real scripts on a Hadoop system using
          <strong>
           Scala, PigLatin,
          </strong>
          and
          <strong>
           Python
          </strong>
          .
         </p>

<em>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI)seems to be a unique technology for making a machine, a robot fully autonomous. AI is an analysis of how the machine is thinking, studying, determining, and functioning when it is trying to solve problems.
           </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
          These kinds of problems are present in all fields, the most emerging ones, and even beyond. The aim of Artificial Intelligence is to enhance machine functions relating to human knowledge, such as reasoning, learning, and problems along with the ability to manipulate things. For example, virtual assistants or chatbots offer expert advice. Smart robots or robot advisors will provide instant research or findings in the fields of finance, insurance, law, the media, and journalism, and medical diagnosis and support will be provided by AI software on the health front. Other advantages include increasing productivity dramatically in research and development programs by reducing time to the market, enhancing the transport and supply chain networks and improving governance by improved decision-making processes etc.
         </p>
<p>
          Artificial Intelligence technology is aiding the following prominent fields and many others:
         </p>
<p>
          Website Creation - ArtificialIntelligence tools can help to create websites and landing pages in merely minutes.
         </p>
<p>
          App Creation - ArtificialIntelligence tools can help to automate the whole concept of creating apps.
         </p>
<p>
          Natural Language Processing (NLP) − This process is simulating the actual interaction with the computer that understands natural language spoken by humans.
         </p>
<p>
          Expert Systems − Learners and users will be provided with guided information and advice on the computer or software.
         </p>
<p>
          Vision Systems −Artificial Intelligence (AI)systems can understand, explain and describe the computer's visual input to the ultimate core.
         </p>
<p>
          Spoken Word or Speech Recognition − Many Artificial Intelligence (AI)based speech recognition systems are capable of listening, voicing and recognizing the user input - i.e. when a person speaks with them. Alexa, Siri and Google's assistant, are examples of this function.
         </p>
<p>
          Machine Learning - Artificial Intelligence (AI)can help users to create and experiment with machine learning models and build data science applications in a flash.
         </p>
<p>
          Video Creation - ArtificialIntelligence (AI)can help to automate video production and cut high costs of hiring resources and teams as everything is taken care of in the cloud.
         </p>
<p>
          Python and Coding tools - ArtificialIntelligence (AI)can help to automate writing lakhs of lines of code in python and even Java or PHPin minutes without the need for a human coder or even someone who will debug the code. Everything is automated in the concept of AI-powered programming.

          taught by Digital Marketing Legend SrinidhiRanganathan
          <strong>
</strong>
          and CivilMasterMind Saranya Srinidhi will change your perspective on the concept of Artificial Intelligence forever to rely on AI tools of the future for your needs. We will cover 100's of Artificial Intelligence (AI)tools that are highly popular in the following fields that include:Machine Learning,Deep Learning, Digital Marketing,Research, Analytics,Voice-cloning, Mind-Cloning, Video Creation, Virtual Reality (VR) based ArtificialIntelligence tools etc. As you learn these AItools you will understand that ArtificialIntelligence has so much evolved in the last 2 to 5 years. You will also see the growth of the emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI)tools across industries that have exploded and its impact on business and society that is emerging at a quick pace. In this incredible journey, you will also encounter businesses that are pushing the limits of automation, search and social media. As you slowly realize that with the brain of a computer, AI would potentially automate control in such sectors as self-employed vehicles and non-manned drones, you will be left spellbound.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           ""Artificial Intelligence (AI)will not only reduce costs by automating processes but also skyrocket revenues by helping startups and corporates introduce new product and service categories at the fastest speed ever imagined with limited resources.""
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
            But, will the jobs die as automation takes over?Will AI will surpass human intelligence this year, itself? The answer to these questions is a ""No"".
           </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
          The development and eventual growth in AI apps helping in productivity will provide workers with a range of opportunities to improve their skills and concentrate on creative aspects. Stating additional forecasts, disruptive market trends are highly likely to occur in the AI Expansion period (i.e. 2025-2030), the opportunity for employment would require a high degree of personalization, innovation or ability tasks which will still require a person to perform them (even though the AI robotic tools have actually speeded up the process). These occupations or technologies are difficult to imagine at this stage, yet these occupations will rapidly increase as new specialization is required when the demand would kick in. The time is coming soon for a global Artificial Intelligence (AI)revolution to strongly emerge.
         </p>
<p>
          Okay. Let's start learning and go on an adventure in Artificial Intelligence. Enrol Now and I will see you inside. Let's rock this world with learning secretive tools. Don't waste any more time.

</strong>
<em>
           Learn to Work with Cascading Style Sheets
          </em>
</p>
<p>
          Students learn to harness the true power of front-end development using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Through comprehensive, hands-on exercises, students will develop stylish, responsive web layouts using CSS properties and style definitions.
         </p>
<p>
          We start with basic concepts such as the parts of a CSS rule and working with Classes, Divisions and IDs. Next we explore an intensive collection of style definition, from working with text, backgrounds and transparency, right to CSS positioning, link styling, and popular layout development techniques.
         </p>
<p>
          Students will have the opportunity to work on several projects to master the limitless potential of this powerful language.

            WHY THIS COURSE IS DIFFERENT?
           </p>
<p>
            Many of the online courses teach you to code but not the theory/way of thinking behind it why would we choose a while but not a for loop, why should we pass 2 parameters to a function but not only one?
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
          This course will teach you how to think about solving coding problems throughout quizzes, there are 112 video format quizzes that aim to keep you engaged with the course and teach you the Python fundamentals in an easy to follow manner

            MEET THE INSTRUCTOR
           </p>
<p>
            We provide a platform for thousands of people to expand the understanding of programming and computer science. Founded in 2013 our mission is to spread the love for programming. To achieve this, we're working hard on providing content that will help people build a solid foundation in those subjects.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            WHAT TO EXPECT
           </p>
<p>
            This course will help you to master the foundation and know-how to solve problems with Python code.
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
          2. The content in a nutshell
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            WHAT EACH UNIT IS ABOUT
           </p>
<p>
            This course will introduce you to the fundamental ideas in computing and teach you to read and write your own computer programs. We are going to do that in the context of building a web search engine.
           </p>
<p>
            Uint 1 will teach you the python grammar and show you how to use variables, strings, and some Python built-in functions to work on them in order to create a web crawler that makes use of those.
           </p>
<p>
            Unit 2 will take you in more depth in using procedures, loops, and the logical constructs in order to add more functionality to the crawler built-in unit 1.
           </p>
<p>
            Unit 3 is about managing data through mastering the use of the different data types to be able to create the search engine index.
           </p>
<p>
            Our biggest goal tho is to learn about computer science, So unit 4 focuses on teaching you how computers store data and how to be cost-effective when doing that. In addition to understanding the foundation of networks and data management.
           </p>
<p>
            By the end of unit 5, you'll have a better understanding of how programs run and how to implement a hash table for our search engine.
           </p>
<p>
            Unit 6 will extend the grammar we introduced in unit 1 and will show you how to get the best result for a search query.
           </p>
<p>
            If the course gets much interaction and feedback, we'll work on units to demonstrate how to code real-world Python applications
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
          That's the content in a nutshell. I hope you're as excited as I'm to start this learning journey, so just the enrollment today and thank me later.

<p>
          This course is the first of a multiple-courses sequence: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python. Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems.
         </p>
<p>
          Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are not ""computation appreciation"" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will.
         </p>
<p>
          In this introduction to computer programming course, you’ll learn and practice key computer science concepts. You’ll learn Python, a powerful, easy-to-learn, and widely used programming language, and you’ll explore computer science basics, as you build your own programs.
         </p>
<p>
          This Computer science and programming using python course will introduce you to the fundamental ideas in computing and teach you to read and write your own computer programs.
         </p>
<p>
          Computer science is about how to solve problems, like building a search engine, by breaking them into smaller pieces and then precisely and mechanically describing a sequence of steps that you can use to solve each piece. And those steps can be executed by a computer.
         </p>
<p>
          In this course, we will not get into everything that you need to be a programmer, but we will cover the main ideas and learn a lot about computer science along the way.
         </p>
<p>
          By the end of this course, you will be
          <strong>
           fluently
          </strong>
          programming in Python and you'll be so good at Python that you can get a job or use the language professionally.
         </p>
<p>
          You'll cover all that you need to be an accomplished Python Programmer. Including:

<p>
          Many accounting students do not receive a physical book, they get to keep from their school, and even if they did, the information could become dated. Students who want a useful reference tool they can keep, and one that can be more easily updated then a textbook, will benefit from a resource such as this.
         </p>
<p>
          Financial accounting is a LARGE topic and is not something that can be done well in 5, 10, or 20, hours of content, as you may see claimed elsewhere. We will cover accounting theory because theory and concepts are what accounting is. We need to learn theory so we can make appropriate adjustments in the real world. Learning procedures without understanding the theory will make us inflexible and unable to adapt to the ever-changing environment. We will learn the theory while we apply them to procedures.
         </p>
<p>
          Financial accounting is relatively standardized in format. In other words, most accounting institutions will cover much the same topics, often in much the same order. We suggest looking up a standard accounting textbook, checking the index, and comparing the topics to the courses you are considering purchasing. We believe this course will line up well to anybody’s needs who want to learn financial accounting.

          Section SEC 14 – Statement of Cash Flows
         </p>
<p>
          The course will start off at the basics and work all the way through the financial accounting topics generally covered in an undergraduate program.
         </p>
<p>
          First, we will describe what financial accounting is and the objectives of financial accounting. We will learn how the double-entry accounting system works by applying it to the accounting equation. In other words, we will use an accounting equation to record financial transactions using a double-entry accounting system.
         </p>
<p>
          We well learn all topics by fist having presentations and then applying the skills using Excel practice problems. If you are not familiar with how to navigate through Excel, it is OK. We will use preformatted worksheets, have step by step instructional videos, and will start off relatively slow.
         </p>
<p>
          The next step is to apply the double-entry accounting system using debits and credits. Debits and credits are a new concept to most people not familiar with accounting, or possibly worse, many people have misconceptions about the meaning of debit and credit due to its use in areas like bank statements, credit cards, and debit cards.
         </p>
<p>
          We will cover the rules related to debits and credits in a lot of detail. We will then record similar transactions we had done using the accounting equation, but now using debits and credits.
         </p>
<p>
          After we get good at recording transactions using debits and credits, we will learn period end adjusting entries. Adjusting entries are used to adjust the books to represent an accrual basis at the period end better, and they are a great tool for enforcing the concepts of accrual accounting.
         </p>
<p>
          Next, we will use the data we have learned to put together by recording financial transactions into financial statements, including the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of equity. We will learn to construct a statement of cash flows much later in the course.
         </p>
<p>
          After completing the financial statements, we will learn how to journalize and post-closing entries. Closing entries are used to clean out temporary accounts and prepare for the transactions that will be recorded in the next period.
         </p>
<p>
          The steps we have just outlined are critically important to all accounting, and we will need a reasonably good understanding of them to move forward. In other words, the better we understand these concepts, the more natural learning the rest of financial accounting will be. We recommend spending a good deal of time on these concepts and reviewing them often. Think of these skills as a baseball player thinks of playing catch or a musician thinks of playing the basic scales. We should put in some practice with the basics every day.
         </p>
<p>
          Next, we will add inventory to the mix. All the skills we have learned will still apply, but we will now record transactions related to the purchase and sale of inventory.
         </p>
<p>
          We will also learn to track inventory using different methods. We can use specific identification. In other words, we can track the exact unit of inventory that was sold as a car dealership would do. However, companies generally use a cost flow assumption with smaller items that are the same in nature, assumptions like First In Fist Out (FIFO) or Last In Last Out (LIFO). A company may also use a weighted average method.
         </p>
<p>
          Next well will consider subsidiary ledger and special journals. Our main focus is on subsidiary ledger related to accounts receivable and accounts payable. Accounts receivable represents money owed to the organization.
         </p>
<p>
          The general ledger will provide the transactions that make up the accounts receivable account balance by date. However, we will want to see this data reported by customers, so we know who owes the company money and how much, and this is the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger.
         </p>
<p>
          We have a similar situation with accounts payable. Accounts payable represent vendors the company owes money to. We will want to sort this information by vendors, so we know which vendors we owe money to and how much.
         </p>
<p>
          Next, we will cover bank reconciliation and internal controls related to cash. The bank reconciliation is one of the most important internal controls outside of the double-entry accounting system itself. All businesses, large and small, should perform a bank reconciliation. The bank reconciliation will reconcile the cash balance on the company’s books to the cash balance reported by the bank as of a specific date, the date of the bank statement, typically the end of the month.
         </p>
<p>
          The bank statement balance will not agree to the book balance due to outstanding items, items recorded by the company, but which have not yet cleared the bank. The outstanding items will be the reconciling items in a bank reconciliation.
         </p>
<p>
          Next will learn how to value accounts receivable and deal with those accounts we will not be able to collect on. In other words, accounts receivable represent money owed to the business for work done in the past. However, some of those receivables may not ever be paid. How do we account for the a customers we do not think will pay and how do we value the accounts receivable account if we believe some of the receivable will may not be collected in the future, but we do not know which ones?
         </p>
<p>
          GAAP generally requires the use of what is called the allowance method to value accounts receivable. We will compare the allowance method to the direct write off method, an easier method but one that does not conform to accrual accounting as well.
         </p>
<p>
          Next, we will cover property plant and equipment. The most difficult concept related to property plant and equipment is calculating and recording depreciation. Deprecation can be calculated using different methods, including the straight-line method, the double-declining balance method, and the units of production method. We will compare and contrast each method in detail.
         </p>
<p>
          We will also consider how to record the purchase and sale of property plant and equipment.
         </p>
<p>
          Next, we will discuss the tracking and reporting of payroll. Payroll is a very large topic because of the payroll laws included in it. We will discuss how to calculate payroll taxes, including federal income tax FIT, social security, and Medicare. We will record journal entries related to payroll. Payroll journal entries are some of the longest and most complex journal entries recorded in the standard accounting cycle.
         </p>
<p>
          Next, we will learn partnership accounting. The concepts we learned related to the double-entry accounting system will apply to partnerships. Our focus now will be on those transactions unique to a partnership form of entity. For example, we will discuss how to allocate net income to each partners capital account. A partnership type of entity is very flexible, and there are many different ways partners can agree on to allocate income.
         </p>
<p>
          We will discuss how to record transactions when a new partner is added to a partnership or when an existing partner leaves a partnership.
         </p>
<p>
          We will also cover how to record the liquidation of a partnership. Much of the liquidation process will apply to the closing of other business entity types as well. However, the partnership type of entity has the added difficulty of allocating the final proceeds to the partners in accordance with their capital accounts.
         </p>
<p>
          Then we will consider transaction unique to a corporation format of entity. Like the partnership form of entity, the corporation will use the same double-entry accounting system we learned at the beginning of the course. In this section, we will learn how to record the sale of capital stock and the sale of preferred stock. We will record transaction related to the purchase of treasury stock. We will discuss how to record cash dividends and stock dividends.
         </p>
<p>
          Then we will learn concepts related to bonds payable, notes payable, and long term liabilities. Many people are familiar with bonds as a type of investment. We will consider bonds from the other side of the transaction with the issuance of bonds. Bonds are often used as a tool to understand the time-value of money concept and interest rates at a deeper level. Therefore, even if you do not plan on recording many transactions related to the issuance of bonds, it is a useful process to learn valuable concepts. Bonds are often issued at a premium or a discount. The premium or discount is then amortized over the life of the bond.
         </p>
<p>
          We will discuss how to record the initial sale of the bond. We will talk about how to amortize the bond discount and premium. We will record transactions related to bond interest, and we will discuss transactions for the dissolution of the bonds.
         </p>
<p>
          The course will also cover the recording of notes payable. One of the most complex components of notes payable is the breaking out of interest and principal portion of the payment. For the task of breaking out interest and principal, we will need an amortization schedule. We will build amortization schedules from scratch, a useful skill to understand.
         </p>
<p>
          The second complication with notes payable is breaking out the current and long term portion of the note. We will use the amortization schedule to perform the task of calculating the current and long term portion of the notes payable.
         </p>
<p>
          Finally, we will discuss how to create a statement of cash flows. The statement of cash flows is on the of primary financial statements along with the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of equity, but the statement of cash flows can be more complicated to construct.
         </p>
<p>
          The statement of cash flows represents the flow of cash broken out into three categories, operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. We have constructed the financial statements using an accrual basis rather than a cash basis. We can think of the statement of cash flows as converting the accrual basis to a cash basis.
         </p>
<p>
          We can use two methods when constructing the operating section of the statement of cash flows, the direct method, and the indirect method. The indirect method is more common and often required, even if we also add the direct method. The indirect method starts with net income in then backs into cash flow from operations.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Sample of part to test in the book that comes with the course:
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          The first questions asked when introduced to any new topic are often:
         </p>
<p>
          • What is it?
         </p>
<p>
          • Why do I need to know it?
         </p>
<p>
          We will address the second question first: why do I need to know accounting?
         </p>
<p>
          Answer: Because it’s fun. Because accounting is fun is likely not the first thing that popped into your mind, but we want to start off with this concept, the idea of thinking of accounting as a kind of game, a sort of puzzle, something we can figure out. Thinking of accounting as a game will make learning accounting much more enjoyable.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Accounting
          </strong>
          can be defined as an “information and measurement system that identifies, records, and communicates relevant information about a company’s business activities”
          <strong>
</strong>
          (John J. Wild, 2015).
         </p>
<p>
          The process of accounting includes the accumulation of data into a relevant form, which can be used for practical decision making.
         </p>
<p>
          Data is often identified using forms and documents such as bills, invoices, and timesheets. Once identified information is input into an accounting system, often an electronic one. The end goal of financial accounting is the creation of financial statements including a balance sheet, income statement, and statement of equity. The financial statements are used to make relevant decisions.
         </p>
<p>
          There are many reasons to learn accounting concepts, other than it being fun, although we always want to keep the fun factor in mind. Some of the most obvious reasons for learning accounting include:
         </p>
<p>
          · Accounting provides a format to understand business whether we are in the accounting department or not. Accounting is the language of business, a way of communicating business objectives and performance. All areas and departments benefit from understanding accounting because it provides a way to communicate between departments and communication is critical to business success.
         </p>
<p>
          · Accounting concepts apply to our personal finances. We all need to deal with our personal finances and learning basic accounting concepts and recording techniques helps ease our mind when dealing with our financial tasks.
         </p>
<p>
          Other reasons for learning accounting, which are not so obvious, include that accounting is a great tool to help develop critical thinking skills. Accounting requires reasoning to work through problems, and the practice of accounting will refine reasoning abilities and help us approach problems in a more systematic way, a more efficient way.
         </p>
<p>
          Accounting can also provide the same sense of satisfaction we receive when completing a puzzle, when mastering a new musical pattern, or when playing a game skillfully. Accounting can provide the same shot of dopamine when we figure out a problem, discern how something works and can claim that the double entry accounting system is in balance.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Accounting can be compared to a game of checkers
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          For example, the game of checkers starts with setting up pieces on a board, a spreadsheet, following a set of rules. To set up the board, we need to have memorized the rules for doing so. Memorizing rules is not the fun aspect of checkers but is a necessary one to receiving the enjoyment of playing the game. Once the board is set up the game of checkers is played by moving pieces according to a set of rules to achieve a certain objective, the elimination of opponent’s pieces.
         </p>
<p>
          Accounting is similar in that we will start off by learning how to set up the board, the accounting board being a T account or ledger. As with checkers, we will need to memorize where the pieces fit on the board, which side of the T account pieces will line up on. Accounting pieces are the accounts and account types which have a normal balance lining up on the left or right side of the board, of the T account or ledger.
         </p>
<p>
          Once we know the normal balance of accounts, we will play the accounting game by applying debits and credits to the accounts following a set of rules which have a particular objective, the creation of relevant information, the creation of financial statements.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           The major obstacles for learning accounting are the same as those for learning music.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          The primary obstacle to learning accounting concepts is the memorization of rules, a simple task, but one most do not find very enjoyable.
         </p>
<p>
          Memorizing rules is the same obstacle holding people back from learning many fulfilling activities, activities like learning music, or a new language. Rules of some kind must be learned to play music. The idea of rules, of structure, of constraints, seems counter-intuitive to the concept of creativity we associate with creating and playing music, but rules, structure, and limitations are often requirements for creativity. For example, writing and especially poetry, requires adherence to strict rules and many great writers have done their best work while constrained by deadlines and editors.
         </p>
<p>
          Whether it be notes, chords, or songs rote memorization is required before these learned concepts can be used to create something new, to create or play music, the structure critically contributing to the creation process. Creating, of course, is the fun part, the fulfilling part, the area to look forward to but memorization is a necessary part, a critical part, and a part well worth the effort.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Confidence in the system is required to learn accounting
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Education is all about asking questions, testing theories, and being skeptical of claims given without a convincing argument, without supporting facts. Accounting is no different. Questioning is essential to setting up an efficient accounting system, but the tradition of questioning can also be used as a crutch, as an excuse for not moving forward and finding our mistakes.
         </p>
<p>
          I recommend accounting students start out having faith that the double entry accounting system works, in a similar way that we have faith that a 1,000 piece puzzle will contain all the pieces required and can be constructed to match the picture on box, because without this confidence we will lose the motivation to move forward, to complete the task, and therefore miss out on the enjoyment of completing the project.
         </p>
<p>
          Confidence in the double entry accounting system is necessary when first learning accounting concepts because doubting the system restricts us from moving forward to complete the necessary steps and look for the mistakes we have made. It is much easier to claim that the system does not work then look for the more likely problem, our own errors.
         </p>
<p>
          Having faith in a system does not mean we should not question a system. Questions are always encouraged, at all times, but it is best to give the concepts the benefit of the doubt and not allow our questioning of the system to be an excuse, a crutch, for not completing a task or figuring out a problem.
         </p>
<p>
          The double entry accounting system has been around for a long time, at least since the Franciscan monk Luca Pacioli around 1494, and while this does not prove its correctness it does show that it has been a useful tool to many in the past, and will therefore likely be a useful tool to many in the future.
         </p>

          Accounting is divided into two major groups; Financial Accounting &amp; Managerial Accounting.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Financial accounting
          </strong>
          has the end goal of generating financial statements, financial statements designed with external user needs in mind. The aim of financial accounting toward external users may seem strange at first because financial data is required and used for internal, managerial, decision making as well but external users have needs that require more reliance on financial statements in many ways.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           External users
          </strong>
          are users outside the company and include investors, creditors, the internal revenues service, and customers. Companies need these external users for things such as investments, loans, and to follow laws and regulations.
         </p>
<p>
          External users do not have intimate knowledge of the business and therefore need assurance to increase the level of trust, trust being a necessary component for business transactions to take place. To increase confidence levels, financial statements are required to follow a strict format of rules designed to standardize the financial reporting. Standardization allows for the comparison of financial information across time and between different companies.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Managerial accounting
          </strong>
          has the goal of generating relevant information for internal decision makers to make sound decisions, for management.
         </p>
<p>
          Managerial accounting does include the use of the same financial information generated in financial accounting, but information is not required to be in a particular format, managerial accounting being less regulated. Management has intimate knowledge of the company, and therefore there is less need for regulations on the format of data and information. Management will determine the best format for managerial statements to assist in making the best decisions.
         </p>
<p>
          Because managerial accounting is less regulated, it is commonly thought that managerial accounting will differ greatly from organization to organization. While it is true that managerial accounting practices will vary from company to company, there are also best practices which are applied, practices that have stood the test of time, those that have helped good companies be great. The study of managerial accounting is the study of best practices used to make good business decisions.
         </p>
<p>
          Financial accounting developed in much the same way, businesses looking for best practices to compile data for both themselves and external users. Over time financial accounting has solidified those best practices into a standardized form. Standardization often limits innovation but does provide a clear format for external users, this being one of the tradeoffs related to regulation. We will talk more about the need for standardization in a profession like accounting when we discuss what a profession is and the need for ethics and regulations within a profession.
         </p>
<p>
          Ethics plays a huge role in accounting as it does in most professions, in part, because ethics deals with trust and trust is an essential component of any business transaction. The concept of ethics is very broad, has been studied intensely since ancient times, and is an area which still has many open questions, but ethics related to accounting can be narrowed from the broader discussion in some ways.
         </p>
<p>
          One way to think of ethics as it relates to a profession is by implementing a kind of categorical imperative, acting in a way that we would wish to be universal for the entire profession. For example, stealing could benefit an individual but if everyone steals everyone is worse off and therefore stealing would be wrong.
         </p>
<p>
          Similarly acting in a way that is misleading could lead to gains for an individual but doing so harms the profession and is therefore wrong. Most professions can apply a concept like this. two of the oldest professions are law and medicine. The reason professions are needed in areas like law, medicine, and accounting is because they deal with specialized knowledge, knowledge most people do not have and that many are dependent on at some point in their lives. An uneven distribution of knowledge can cause incentives for individuals to seek short term gains through deceit.
         </p>
<p>
          For example, somebody claiming to know medicine could administer medicine that is not effective and the patient would not know, a patient having no choice but to trust the expertise of the doctor. If a physician abuses trust by administering remedies that are not effective, they are profiting off the name of the profession, from the brand of the occupation, and if this practice is done enough, it will result in a lack of trust in medicine.
         </p>
<p>
          A similar scenario can be painted for many areas of accounting, accounting having advanced to a specialized field, one that most do not understand, but are forced to deal in at some point or another. The need for trust drives and incentivizes a profession to self-regulate, to build a brand. One way the accounting profession self-regulates is by requiring different certifications to practice in different areas, certifications like a certified public accountant CPA license. A certification process helps provide the public with a level of trust that an individual has some basic understanding of concepts they are dealing with and provides ethical standards that must be met.
         </p>
<p>
          An example of the need for trust in accounting is when investors use financial statements to make investment decisions. Publicly traded stocks have an increased need for transparency in their financial reporting because their stock is being sold and traded by the public, a huge benefit to both companies and investors, providing capital to companies, and opportunities for gain to investors.
         </p>
<p>
          For an individual to invest, however, they need to analyze their options, and financial statements are the primary tool for this analysis. If investors do not have confidence in the numbers reported on the financial statements, do not understand how the numbers are reported, or cannot compare the numbers to related companies, investment transactions will decline due to a lack of information and trust.
         </p>
<p>
          The economy needs trust in the system as a major component which keeps interactions taking place, compelling people to take calculated risks, driving individuals to do business and drive growth and innovation.
         </p>
<p>
          Fraud is one component in the discussion of ethics, fraud being the deliberate attempt to deceive for personal gain. Fraud can take many forms in business from theft to falsifying the financial statements to drive up stock prices and increase bonus pay.
         </p>
<p>
          Most people believe fraud is all about employing the right people, honest people, those with integrity. While the right people is a huge component, it is not the only one. Good people in a bad environment or culture can fall victim to the group mentality. Businesses can reduce the likelihood of fraud by recognizing conditions that foster fraud and taking active steps in reducing them.
         </p>
<p>
          A criminologist has introduced the idea of a
          <strong>
           fraud triangle
          </strong>
          , consisting of three factors which increase the likelihood of fraud.
          <strong>
           Fraud factors
          </strong>
          include
          <strong>
           opportunity
          </strong>
          ,
          <strong>
           pressure
          </strong>
          , and
          <strong>
           rationalization
          </strong>
          .
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Opportunity
          </strong>
          means that the ability to commit fraud and not be caught is present, or at least perceived. For example, if a company had a policy of keeping their petty cash fund in a shoebox in the middle of the lunch room the opportunity for theft without detection would be greater than if the money was put into a more secure location.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Pressure
          </strong>
          or incentive means that a person is under pressure of some kind, often financial. If money if tight the likelihood of an individual committing fraud is significantly increased.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Rationalization
          </strong>
          is when a person justifies an action. Our minds are excellent at rationalizing. We generally believe that we think before acting, but we often act and then justify the action through rationalization. Rationalization is one reason fraud tends to continue, and even escalate over time.
         </p>
<p>
          For example, if a company left the petty cash in the lunchroom an employee may rationalize theft by reasoning that it’s the company’s fault for not better safeguarding their assets. While it may be true that leaving cash in the middle of the lunchroom is not a good internal control for a company, it is not a justification for theft. Another common rationalization is that a company is vast and rich while an employee may feel small and poor and taking to from the rich to give to the poor is not bad. Again, there may be some truth to this statement, but it is not a reason justifying theft.
         </p>
<p>
          Companies can reduce the likelihood of fraud by recognizing these fraud factors and taking active steps to reduce them, steps including internal controls. For example, companies should safeguard assets and should create a culture of honesty, communication, and respect, a culture that needs to be demonstrated from the top down. If the culture is bad at the top good employees will not be able to pull up the culture from the bottom.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Objectivity –
          </strong>
          To provide information useful to investors creditors, and others. The concept of objectivity seems obvious, but we always need to keep the end goal in mind, the creation of useful information for external users. Financial accounting is aimed at producing useful information for external users like investors, creditors, and customers, the format of this information usually being financial statements. By anticipating the needs of external users, we can set rules and guidelines to provide the most value.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Qualitative Characteristics
          </strong>
          – To require information that is relevant, reliable, and comparable. The characteristics of relevance, reliability, and comparability are related to the objective of providing useful information because external users will value these features.
         </p>
<p>
          ·
          <strong>
           Relevant
          </strong>
          means the information is relevant or necessary to the needs of the users. Relevant information could be information that influences the decision-making process. For example, a bank deciding whether to make a loan to a business may request financial statements to assess the likelihood of a business’s ability to pay the loan back in the future.
         </p>
<p>
          ·
          <strong>
           Reliable
          </strong>
          means that the information must be trusted or must be believed that it is free of material errors and is presented in a fair way. For example, a bank deciding whether to make a loan to a business may request financial statements and want assurance that they can be trusted. Part of the assurance requirement may be that the financial statements are presented in a standardized form, following a standardized set of rules. A bank may also ask for a third-party review or audit to add to the level of reliability.
         </p>
<p>
          ·
          <strong>
           Comparability
          </strong>
          means that financial information needs to be comparable to prior periods and other companies. Comparability requires standardization, a systematic way of compiling data from one time to the next. For example, a bank deciding whether to make a loan to a business may want to compare financial
         </p>
<p>
          statement performance with prior years to see if there has been an improvement and to compare financial statements to other businesses in the industry. For comparisons of financial statements to be relevant, there needs to be conformity in presentation.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Going-concern assumption -
          </strong>
          the presumption that the business will continue operating instead of being closed. We assume a business is in business to stay in business, to have an objective of revenue generation and growth. If a business is planning on stopping business or is going bankrupt their behavior is likely to be much different than if they planned on continuing business. A business that is not a going concern, one that plans on stopping operations, needs to disclose this information to the readers of their financial statements so that readers can change their default assumption that the business will remain in business.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Separate business entity assumption -
          </strong>
          means that the business accounting will be kept separate from personal accounting and that of other businesses. Separating business accounting and personal accounting is clear conceptually, the separation providing more relevant information for making business decisions, but can be difficult in practice. The driving concept for deciding whether an accounting transaction is business or personal is the objective behind the transaction, the reason for the transaction. Every transaction will have a reason and we need to determine if the reason is business or personal in nature.
         </p>
<p>
          The business objective is revenue generation. A business’s mission statement will define what a business does to generate revenue, but from an accounting standpoint, the objective of revenue generation will help guide business actions and help us categorize transactions as either business or personal.
         </p>
<p>
          Personal objectives may include a goal of being happy or living well. Personal objectives will vary from person to person, and for more detail on personal objectives we would need to consult the study of philosophy, a topic for another time, but the objective of living well will suit our needs. If the driving reason for a transaction is to be happy or to live well, rather than the business accounting will be kept separate from personal accounting and that of other businesses. Separating business accounting and personal accounting is clear conceptually, the separation providing more relevant information for making business decisions, but can be difficult in practice. The driving concept for deciding whether an accounting transaction is business or personal is the objective behind the transaction, the reason for the transaction.

<p>
          Personal objectives may include a goal of being happy or living well. Personal objectives will vary from person to person, and for more detail on personal objectives we would need to consult the study of philosophy, a topic for another time, but the objective of living well will suit our needs. If the driving reason for a transaction is to be happy or to live well, rather than the more specific objective of revenue generation, the transaction is a personal one.
         </p>
<p>
          An example of separating business and personal objectives is the creation of a separate business checking account, a separate account allowing us to track the business revenue and expenditures more quickly, most deposits into the business checking account being revenue and most withdrawals being expenses.
         </p>
<p>
          The difference between a business expense and a personal expense is the objective for the expense. For example, if we went out to dinner the cost of the meal may be business or personal depending on the objective. If we took clients to dinner to pick up new business engagements, the meal would be a business expense and if we took our family out to dinner to have fun and live well it would be a personal expense.
         </p>
<p>
          In a similar way as expenses can be either business or personal, assets can also be either business or personal in nature. For example, if we purchase a building with the intention of making widgets for sale the building would be an asset rather than an expense because it will help generate revenue in the future and has not yet been consumed. On the other hand, if we purchase a building to live in as a home it would be a personal asset, the objective being to live well.
         </p>
<p>
          We can think of many areas where business and personal objectives overlap, areas were categorizing the transaction is difficult. For example, we may take both family and clients to dinner or we may work from our home. As accountants, our job is to differentiate the business and personal portion as much as possible to better measure our performance.
         </p>
<p>
          Our business objectives can be thought of as fitting inside our larger personal objectives, the generation of revenue being part of our larger personal goals of living well.
         </p>
<p>
          As the business grows and achieves the business objective of revenue generation owners can begin taking money and resources out of the business to be used for their larger personal objectives of living well.
         </p>

          “Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are uniform minimum standards of, and guidelines to, financial accounting and reporting. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), and the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) are authorized to establish these principles.” (AICPA, n.d.)
         </p>
<p>
          Financial Accounting strives to generate financial information that is relevant, reliable, and comparable because these characteristics create value to users of financial reports, particularly to external users of financial reports.
         </p>
<p>
          Creating and implementing standard guidelines for the processing and reporting of financial statements makes the financial statements more relevant, reliable, and comparable. Standards help to standardize financial reporting, making financial statements comparable across time and to other companies.
         </p>
<p>
          The Securities and Exchange Commission SEC has authority to set Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP and the SEC has delegated much of the responsibilities of setting GAAP to the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB. The SEC is a governmental agency, and the FASB is a private sector group. The system of delegating authority to a private sector group makes sense because the accounting profession, like any profession, has an incentive to self-regulate and has a better understanding of the problems within the profession and how best to address them.

          There are many useful ways to separate and categorize business entities, one being by business form, by type of business structure; another being by a business's relation to inventory, whether the business is selling inventory and whether they produce the inventory they are selling.
         </p>
<p>
          The three broad categories of business structure are a sole proprietorship, partnership, and corporation.
         </p>
<p>
          A
          <strong>
           sole proprietorship
          </strong>
          is a business owned by one person and is the most common type of business in the United States. The benefits of a sole proprietorship are that they are easy and inexpensive to form. An individual who starts acting as a business, generating revenue, is a sole proprietor by default unless they create some other type of organizations. The income from a sole proprietor is taxable but will be reported on the individual tax return, on Form 1040 supported by a supplemental Schedule C.
         </p>
<p>
          The disadvantages of a sole proprietor include limited personal liability protection and limited capital generation capability when compared to other types of organizations.
         </p>
<p>
          A
          <strong>
           partnership
          </strong>
          is similar to a sole proprietor except that the business now has two or more partners. A partnership has the same benefit of easy formation and the same drawbacks of liability exposure and limited capital generation.
         </p>
<p>
          A
          <strong>
           corporation
          </strong>
          is a separate legal entity. Corporations are less common than the sole proprietorship but generate the largest percentage of total U.S. revenue. The benefits of a corporation include that they provide liability protection through being a separate legal entity, the theory being that the assets of the corporation are liable but personal assets are not, personal assets having more protection when compared to other types of organizations. The disadvantages of a corporation include that they are more costly to form, more complicated to maintain, and can result in double taxation.
         </p>
<p>
          Much more can be said about types of entities, but this will provide a starting point. From an accounting perspective, we will start out with transactions related to a sole proprietorship and then move to a partnership and then a corporation. The reason for starting with the sole proprietorship is that it is a business form that most people can relate to and because many of the transactions found in a sole proprietorship will be the same for all entity types.
         </p>
<p>
          We will then move to a partnership, concentrating on the areas that are different from a sole proprietorship. Many of the transactions and processes will be the same, both entities needing to record the paying of the rent, employees, and utilities, both entities recording revenue. Transactions will differ, however, in the equity section because a partnership will have two or more owners, so the equity section is where we will spend much of our time.
         </p>
<p>
          We will then move to a corporation, concentrating on the areas that are different. Many transactions will remain the same, but the equity section is one area that will differ, the owners now being stockholders.
         </p>
<p>
          Another useful way to categorize businesses is by industry or by whether they use inventory and whether they produce inventory. A service company does not sell inventory, a merchandising business purchases and sells inventory, and a manufacturing business produces inventory to sell.
         </p>
<p>
          A company’s relationship with inventory has a significant impact on many accounting transactions and reporting. We will start out with a service company, using similar logic as we did when starting out with a sole proprietorship. Service companies have many of the same transactions as companies that deal with inventory, but they do not need to track inventory. We will then move to merchandising companies, companies that buy and sell inventory, adding the items that are different, items related to inventory. We will then move to a manufacturing companies, companies that produces inventory, adding things that differ, the tracking of inventory from raw materials to work in process and then to finished goods.
         </p>
<p>
          Generally Accepted Accounting Principle GAAP will be based on accrual concepts. The accrual basis can be compared and contrasted to a cash basis, the cash basis being a simplified method, one which does not provide information as useful, as relevant, or as accurate as an accrual method.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Cash basis
          </strong>
          – Records revenue when cash is received and expenses when cash is paid. A cash basis is not the basis required by GAAP, GAAP rules following an accrual basis, but understanding a cash basis helps in understanding both how an accrual basis works and the reasons for it. Cash and revenue are not the same things, as we will see when we record transactions, but a cash basis uses cash as an indicator of when revenue will be recorded. The concept of a cash basis is like a firefighter following the smoke to get to a fire, the smoke not pinpointing the exact location but being close enough. Cash collection does not always equal the exact location in time of revenue earnings but is often close enough.
         </p>
<p>
          In a similar way as revenue being recorded when cash is received under a cash basis, expenses are recorded when cash is paid under a cash basis. Cash and expenses are also not the same things, as we will see when we record transactions, but a cash basis uses cash as an indicator of when expenses will be recorded. The concept of a cash basis is like a firefighter following the smoke to get to a fire, the smoke not pinpointing the exact location but being close enough. Cash payment does not always equal the exact location in time expenses were incurred but is often close enough.
         </p>
<p>
          Very few businesses use a pure cash basis because there are times when the smoke is not close to the fire, times when revenue is not close to cash collection, and times when expense incursion is not close to cash payment. For example, almost any business would recognize a cash payment of $100,000 for a building as an asset of a building rather than an expense of building expense even though cash is paid. The reason a building is recorded as an asset is that the asset has not yet been consumed, has not yet been used to generate revenue.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Accrual basis
          </strong>
          – is driven by two main principles, the revenue recognition principle and the matching principle. Revenue recognition deals with the time to recognize revenue and the matching principle deals with the time to record expenses.
         </p>
<p>
          The revenue recognition principle records revenue when the revenue is earned, a time which is not always the same as when revenue is paid. Finding the exact time that revenue has been earned is not always easy but is usually when the job has been completed. For example, the time when revenue has been earned for a service company is when the job has been completed, when the service is done, and the time when revenue has been earned for a merchandising company is when inventory is delivered to the customer. An accrual method is closer to a firefighter using a GPS system to pinpoint the exact location of a fire rather than just estimating the location by following the smoke.
         </p>
<p>
          For example, a food truck may have a policy of only accepting cash for food. The policy of accepting cash as the only form of payment means the time cash is received and the time work is done will be the same. Therefore, both a cash method and an accrual method will result in the same journal entry but for different reasons, the cash method being driven by the cash received, the accrual method being driven by the earnings of the income, by the delivery of the food.
         </p>
<p>
          A bookkeeping business, on the other hand, will often need to perform work, invoice the client on completion of the work, expecting a check in the mail sometime in the future. The revenue recognition principle would require revenue to be recognized at the time the work was done, often when the invoice was generated and not when cash was received. We will cover the format of these transactions a little later but for now, recognize that revenue is the act of earning revenue which is different from receiving cash, cash usually being the form of payment for revenue earned. There are other forms of payment, including trade or barter, but cash is the most common form of payment. The revenue recognition principle is similar to how most of us think of our paychecks when working for a company. A business may pay employees every other week, but an employee has earned the revenue in the week the work was done. The company is expected to pay the employee for work done even if the employee leaves the company. For example, if an employee earned wages of $1,000 last week according to their employment agreement and employment is terminated this week the employee will still expect payment of $1,000 for the work performed last week, for revenue that was earned by the employee last week even though cash had not yet been received.
         </p>
<p>
          It is possible, but less common, to receive cash before work is performed, revenue still being recorded at the time work is done under an accrual basis rather than the time payment is received. For example, a newspaper company will collect money before doing the work, before delivering newspapers. A newspaper company will often collect money for a year’s subscription and then earn the revenue by delivering the newspapers in the future. Under an accrual method the newspaper company will have to wait on recording revenue until they earn the revenue by doing work, by delivering the papers, even though they already have the cash in hand. Even though the company has the cash related to future sales they have not earned the revenue for those

Even though the company has the cash related to future sales they have not earned the revenue for those future sales and if they do not deliver the newspapers in the future they will owe the money back.

          As mentioned earlier there are many ways the double entry accounting system can be expressed including the use of an accounting equation, debits and credits, and a balance sheet. We will focus on the accounting equations in this section. The benefits of an accounting equation include the use of a simple formula, simple math that can be explained and understood. Transactions will be described using the symmetry of the accounting equation. The problem with using the accounting equation to record transactions and build the financial statements is that it is not as efficient as the use of debits and credits. We will learn the balancing concept using the accounting equation, but as we do, keep in mind that the accounting equation is not the whole story, that we will need to understand new concepts, the concepts of debits and credits, to record data with which to generate financial statements well.
         </p>
<p>
          The accounting equation is:
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Asset = Liabilities + Equity
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          The format above is the most common form of the accounting equation for financial accounting because the left side of the equation shows what the business owns and the right side shows who it is owed to, either a third-party liability or the owner. Recall our separate business entity assumption while considering the accounting equation. Thinking of the business as a separate entity helps to understand the accounting equation, the left side of the equal sign showing what the separate entity owns, the right showing who has claim to what the separate entity owns.
         </p>
<p>
          Because the accounting equation is a formula it can be expressed at least two other ways. A second way to write the equation is:
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Assets – Liabilities = Equity
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          The format of the accounting equation above is useful because it emphasizes that equity is the book value of the company, the amount left over after subtracting liabilities from assets, an amount which can also be called net assets. To understand the meaning of equity we can consider the liquidation of a company, the selling of assets for cash, the payment of liabilities owed, and the leftover cash which would then be available to the owner, this amount being equal to equity if assets were sold at book value. Note that all assets will not be sold for the exact amount reported when a business is sold. For example, an asset of equipment valued at $50,000 may not be sold for $50,000 in a free market, possibly being sold for something less like $40,000 or something more like $60,000. We will discuss this more at a later time. For now, remember that equity represents net assets on a book value basis, assets minus liabilities.
         </p>
<p>
          A third way to write the accounting equation is:
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Assets – Equity = Liabilities
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          This format of the accounting equation is not as useful but is another way the accounting equation can be expressed algebraically.
         </p>
<p>
          Account types include assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses. Recognize that account types are not the same thing as actual accounts, each account type having multiple accounts falling into the category. Understanding account types and the accounts that fall into each account type category is essential to the accounting process.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Assets
          </strong>
          are resources owned by the business. The most common asset is cash, but assets also include accounts receivable, prepayments, land, building, and equipment. Assets are items that have not yet been consumed, resources planned to be used in the future to achieve business goals, to help generate revenue.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Liabilities
          </strong>
          are claims by creditors. Liabilities come about from a transaction that happens in the past which obligates the company for some form of future payment. Purchasing something on a credit card is an example of how a liability can be created, the transaction creating a future obligation to pay cash. Liability accounts include accounts payable, notes payable, and bonds payable.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Equity
          </strong>
          is the owner’s claim to assets. Equity is equal to assets minus liabilities. Equity is often the most confusing section of the accounting equation, in part, because different organization types will organize the equity section differently and because the equity section is involved in the closing process of temporary accounts.
         </p>
<p>
          The equity section represents what is owed to the owner on a book basis. This is best illustrated by imagining we liquidate or close a business, selling the assets for cash, and then paying off the liabilities. The money left over would be equal to the equity section if all sales were made on a book value basis.
         </p>
<p>
          The equity section for a sole proprietor will be called owner’s equity and consist of one capital account. The equity section of a partnership will be called partnership equity and consist of two or more owners and therefore two or more capital accounts. The equity section of a corporation will be called shareholder’s equity, shareholders being the owners of a corporation, and will included capital stock and retained earnings. Although the format changes the equity section taken as a whole can still be thought of as what is owed to the owner or owners in each case.
         </p>
<p>
          When thinking about the accounting equation, the equity section includes all temporary accounts, including revenue accounts and expense accounts.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Revenue -
          </strong>
          is income generated from performing work. Revenue is not the same thing as cash. Cash is a form of payment while revenue represents the creation of value and the earning of compensation. Revenue is a timing account, needing to be measured over a time frame, a starting and ending point. For example, when somebody says they earn $100,000 the concept has no meaning unless we assign a time frame, most people naturally attributing a year as the time frame when hearing a number like $100,000. A different time frame would have a much different meaning. For example, revenue of $100,000 a month is much different than revenue of $100,000 a year.
         </p>
<p>
          We can contrast temporary accounts, like revenue and expense accounts, with permanent accounts like cash. Saying we have $100,000 cash does not require a time frame to define what we mean because cash is a permanent account, representing a position at a point in time.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Expense
          </strong>
          is the using of assets or incurrence of liabilities as part of operations to generate revenue. Expenses are what a business needs to consume to achieve the goal of revenue generation. Expenses are also temporary accounts needing a beginning and ending time.
         </p>
<p>
          There are usually many more expense accounts then revenue accounts, but we hope the revenue accounts add up to a greater dollar amount. The reason there are more expense accounts then revenue accounts is because of specialization, companies focusing on earning money by doing what they do best and paying for their other needs.
         </p>
<p>
          Before we demonstrate common transactions and how they are analyzed using the accounting equating we will cover transaction rules. Applying a process for recording transactions will reduce the likelihood of making bad assumptions and learning rules that do not apply in all cases.
         </p>
<p>
          It is possible to learn rules that apply in only some cases, requiring the unlearning of these rules when we move to cases where they do not apply. Learning rules that do not apply in all cases should be avoided because unlearning rules in cases where a bad rule does not apply is tough.
         </p>
<p>
          Learning and applying the steps below for recording transactions helps avoid problems, eliminating the need to unlearn false concepts in the future. These same rules will apply when we move to learning debits and credits at which time we will build on these rules, applying more concepts to the balancing ideas developed here.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Transaction Rules:
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           ·
          </strong>
          Every transaction will affect at least two accounts.
         </p>
<p>
          · Every transaction will keep the accounting equation in balance.
         </p>
<p>
          Transaction thought process
         </p>
<p>
          When first learning transactions we will repeat this thought process for each transaction, the thought process being designed to make the recording of transactions as easy as possible, and avoid learning rules that are not always applicable. This process will make more sense as we work through transactions. Working transactions is the only way to understand the double entry accounting system fully.
         </p>
<p>
          We will now go through common financial transactions, transactions needed by most any business, and analyze them using the accounting equation and our set of rules and thought processes.
         </p>
<p>
          We will start off looking at transactions involving cash, cash being the most common account affected. Understanding how cash is affected will act like an add, or crutch, when considering the other account or accounts effected in the transaction.
         </p>
<p>
          First, imagine a situation where the cash goes up because the company received cash, and consider possibilities for the other account affected.
         </p>
<p>
          We know that at least one other account will be effect and that the accounting equation must remain in balance. If there is only one other account effected we are left with just three possibilities to keep the accounting equation in balance. Either the liabilities went up, equity went up, or another asset account also went down. Below are examples of each.
         </p>
<p>
          If cash went up because of a business receiving a bank loan, then liabilities would also go up, keeping the accounting equation in balance.
         </p>
<p>
          If cash went goes up do to collecting cash for work the company did then revenue or income would also go up, revenue being part of equity.
         </p>
<p>
          If cash went up because we are receiving money for work done in the past we would also reduce the accounts receivable account, an asset account representing money owed to the company for past work completed.
         </p>
<p>
          It is possible to use an expanded accounting equation, listing all accounts under each account type, forming a kind of trial balance which can be used to create the financial statements. We will not be using this format here because it is not an efficient way to generate financial statements and gives the impression that debits and credits are not needed, which is not a good impression to give.
         </p>
<p>
          To understand double entry accounting and how financial statements are created, the accounting equation is not sufficient, and debits and credit will be needed. We will introduce how debits and credits work later, but the concepts will build on the concepts we learn here working with the accounting equation.
         </p>
<p>
          Below are more common transaction and the effect on the accounting equation:
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Owner invests cash into the business:
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          The asset account of cash goes up as well as equity, the amount owed to the owner. Equity goes up because the business basically owes the cash back to the owner. When investing cash into a business, an owner is hoping to receive a return on investment and be able to withdraw cash from the business in the future, to be used for personal use.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Purchase of supplies for cash:
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          The asset of cash goes down, but another asset of supplies goes up, the net result being no change in any account type of the account equation. The result of a transaction with no change to the accounting equation is one reason debits and credits are a more efficient way to record transactions then the use of the accounting equation. We will record much the same transaction using debits and credits later.
         </p>
<p>
          The increase in supplies is an increase in an asset type account rather than an expense type account, expenses being part of equity, because of the accrual accounting principle of matching. When the supplies are purchased, they have not yet been used to help generate revenue but will help to generate revenue in the future. Supplies will be expensed in the time they are used or consumed to help generate revenue.
         </p>
<p>
          Supplies will be our introduction to an inventory system because supplies will be tracked in a similar way as inventory. The recording of supplies will start with reporting supplies as an asset, followed by the counting of supplies at end of a time period, like a month, to determine how much has been used, and then the recording of the decrease is the supplies asset account and recording of the supplies utilized in the supplies expense account.
         </p>
<p>
          Supplies may be expenses when purchased if the amount is not material, not significant to decision making, because expensing the supplies is an easier process than capitalizing as an asset when the amount is not significant to decision making. For example, if we purchased two years’ worth of paper-clips for $100 we may just expense the purchase because the cost of $100 is not significant to decision making, $100 not being an amount that wi

<strong>
           Origen del curso:
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Este curso surgió, porque muchos alumnos me preguntan mucho cosas cómo:
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            ¿Cómo hiciste eso?
           </p>
</li>

<p>
            ¿Cómo editaste el código tan rápido?

<p>
            ¿Qué hiciste para cambiar todo a la vez?

</li>
<li>
<p>
            Etc.
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
          Entonces tuve la idea de crear este curso para crear video tutoriales de una forma estructurada, que me permita explicarles cómo hago todo eso.

          </strong>
          trabajar con frameworks, debuggers, enlace con funcionalidades de otros programas, etc... Tampoco explicaré que hace cada opción de cada menú de VSCode. No, el objetivo es ayudarles a editar su código a mayor velocidad y utilizar los atajos que más les resulten útiles para su trabajo.
         </p>

<p>
          Posiblemente el curso siga creciendo dependiendo de cómo vaya pasando el tiempo y las necesidades cambien.

          Hello everyone and welcome to Adobe XD Ultimate Guide 2022.
         </p>
<p>
          I'm in instructor Josh Werner and welcome to the course.
         </p>
<p>
          In this video we're going to be talking about the importance of Adobe XD and then also the curriculum
         </p>
<p>
          that we're going to be covering in this course.
         </p>
<p>
          So let's jump into the importance of adobe XD.
         </p>
<p>
          So Adobe XD is designed for user experience and user interface.
         </p>
<p>
          So what that does is the user interface is the way that something looks, the layout, the design of
         </p>
<p>
          an app, a website, even on your TV.
         </p>
<p>
          The way that an app is designed for you to interact with video on a streaming service, for example,
         </p>
<p>
          that's user interface experience is different.
         </p>
<p>
          How do you interact with that?
         </p>
<p>
          How do you click on something?
         </p>
<p>
          How do you touch something?
         </p>
<p>
          If you're using a smartphone or tablet or a touch screen device, how do you interact with that?
         </p>
<p>
          That's the user experience.
         </p>
<p>
          And so both of these things are important.
         </p>
<p>
          And what Adobe XD allows you to do is wireframe or prototype an app, a website, and then use the prototype
         </p>
<p>
          to run that application in XD and test it out and see how the experience is.
         </p>
<p>
          So you can do the user interface or the design, and then you can also test it with how it would be
         </p>
<p>
          with a user experience.
         </p>
<p>
          So it's a way for you to do both.
         </p>
<p>
          So that's why Adobe XD is important.
         </p>
<p>
          Now to the curriculum.
         </p>
<p>
          What are we going to be learning in this course?
         </p>
<p>
          We're going to be talking about creative cloud plans, why each plan is unique and and where it's best
         </p>
<p>
          served.
         </p>
<p>
          Like should you use an individual plan, a business plan, a students and teachers plan, or schools
         </p>
<p>
          and universities plan, and what each one of those are and which one should use.
         </p>
<p>
          Then we're going to talk about how to set up a creative cloud account, and we'll also cover Creative
         </p>
<p>
          Cloud Web and how to use that interface to install Adobe XD.
         </p>
<p>
          From there, we're going be talking about the welcome page, the main menu and tools, and then we're
         </p>
<p>
          going to get into the fun part of the course.
         </p>
<p>
          We're going to build from scratch 35 fantastic projects that you're really going to enjoy and it's going
         </p>
<p>
          to take your skill to the next level.
         </p>
<p>
          It's going to level you up and help you to learn XD through building projects.
         </p>
<p>
          So I want to welcome you to Adobe XD Ultimate Guide 2022.

<p>
          In this Photoshop course, I introduce, explain, and demonstrate the various tools in Photoshop. Every single tool is covered, with the exception of 3D tools. I also go over the various ways to make selections in Photoshop, including techniques that do not use a tool. Advanced modes and options are also covered. By the time you've finished this course, you will be an expert at Photoshop's tools. However, some students may option not to complete the entire course and instead use this as a reference to learn about specific tools. If that's the case, jump around to which tool you have questions about, even though you might be missing some helpful content by not completing all the lectures. The lectures are ordered in the order they are located in the Tools panel.
         </p>
<p>
          Students can follow along in Photoshop and practice adjusting the various tools’ options and use them in conjunction with each other, whether it’s the Type Tools, the Pen Tools, or the Shape Tools, or digital darkroom tools like the Clone Stamp Tool, the Sponge Tool, and so on.
         </p>
<p>
          There are 11 lectures on the various selection tools. This could normally be a course by itself, but it is included as one section in this course. If you complete this course, you will be an expert at making selections in Photoshop!
         </p>
<p>
          I have years of experience using Photoshop, including doing web and advertising design at a newspaper, an advertising design firm, a library system, and freelance work for about two decades. I’ve also been managing editor at two international graphic design magazines (helping run Photoshop World in Las Vegas), and I’m currently a full-time professor of graphic design and digital media. I’ve taken classes on digital production and design during my undergraduate and graduate work.

<p>
          Enroll today and let’s learn about Photoshop’s tools and their neat uses and effects.

          Hello everyone and welcome to Adobe Illustrator 2022 Ultimate Guide.
         </p>
<p>
          In this video, we're going to go over an in-depth overview of what we're going to be learning throughout this course.
         </p>
<p>
          So let's jump into it.
         </p>
<p>
          So in Section two, we're going to talk about Adobe Creative Cloud 2022 plans and pricing.
         </p>
<p>
          So we'll cover individuals, business students and teachers and schools, universities.
         </p>
<p>
          Then we'll talk about how to set up a free creative cloud account.
         </p>
<p>
          And then we'll talk about creative cloud web and how to install Adobe Illustrator.
         </p>
<p>
          Step by step from there, we'll talk about the welcome page, which you can see right here.
         </p>
<p>
          And we'll cover new file, open home.
         </p>
<p>
          Learn your file shared with you and deleted.
         </p>
<p>
          And then cloud search.
         </p>
<p>
          And what's new in Adobe Illustrator, which you can see right here.
         </p>
<p>
          And then the account from there we're going to talk about.
         </p>
<p>
          The interface with a basic project, which you can see this is the actual basic project we're going to build and we're going to talk about the main menu.
         </p>
<p>
          So file edit, object, type, select, affect, view, window and help.
         </p>
<p>
          And then inside a window we'll talk about workspaces and then we'll cover all of these panels and what they do step by step.
         </p>
<p>
          Then we'll jump into preferences.
         </p>
<p>
          So you can see all of the preferences here, and then we'll do an in-depth dive into the tools.
         </p>
<p>
          And while we're learning about these tools, we're going to build out all this and get a clear understanding of how the tools work inside of after inside of Illustrator not after effects.
         </p>
<p>
          I'm thinking about After Effects, what we're talking about Illustrator.
         </p>
<p>
          So we're going to learn about that.
         </p>
<p>
          Okay, then the fun part is going to come.
         </p>
<p>
          We're going to build a hundred projects from scratch.
         </p>
<p>
          Yes, it's a lot of projects, but it's going to be a lot of fun.
         </p>
<p>
          So let's take a deep dive into that and look at what we're going to be doing.
         </p>
<p>
          So we're going to make a folder on the cloud.
         </p>
<p>
          So Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe Illustrator 2022, we're going to make two subfolders so learn tech plus and does cloud gaming.
         </p>
<p>
          So Learn Tech Plus, we're going to build out 30 projects from scratch step by step, and then we're going to build out 70 projects for dust cloud gaming step by step.
         </p>
<p>
          I'll walk you through and trust me when I tell you this is going to be a ton of fun.
         </p>
<p>
          You have a great time, so get excited about it.
         </p>
<p>
          And once that's done, then we'll wrap up the course.
         </p>
<p>
          Well, the summary of what we learned.
         </p>
<p>
          So with that, I want to thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video.

<strong>
           Content and Overview
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          To feel comfortable in this course, you will need some prior knowledge of HTML and CSS. Beyond that, it is
          <strong>
           very beginner friendly
          </strong>
          , as we go through different programming structures using PHP. Even if you have no exposure to any web development, you will be able to follow along from scratch.
         </p>
<p>
          This is a huge course. Over 12 hours of premium content, but smartly broken up to highlight a set of related activities based on each feature in the application that is being built. We will also look at troubleshooting and debugging errors as we go along; implementing best practices; writing efficient logic and understanding why developers do things the way they do. Your knowledge will grow, step by step, throughout the course and you will be challenged to be the best you can be.
         </p>
<p>
          By the time you have finished the course you will have moved around in
          <strong>
           Visual Studio Code
          </strong>
          ,
          <strong>
           XAMPP
          </strong>
          ,
          <strong>
           GitHub
          </strong>
          and
          <strong>
           MySQL
          </strong>
          , that it will become second nature for you when working on a future PHP project. This will put your new learned skills into practical use and
          <strong>
           impress your boss and coworkers
          </strong>
          .
         </p>
<p>
          The course is
          <strong>
           complete with working files hosted on GitHub, with the inclusion of some files to make it easier for you to replicate the code being demonstrated
          </strong>
          . You will be able to work alongside the author as you work through each lecture and will receive a verifiable certificate of completion upon finishing the course.

<p>
          Hi, Welcome to the Python Programming Beyond The Basics And Intermediate Training.
          <br/>
          In this course, you will get a hands-on Many important topics that need to be mastered in order to create applications of multiple scales and purposes in Python programming language.
         </p>
<p>
          By the end of this course, you’ll have the Intermediate concepts that every Python developer should have, and know how to use them practically in all the fields of the Python language.
         </p>
<p>
          Even if you are in any field such as data science, web development or machine learning, it is very necessary to know all the concepts that we will talk about in this course, as well as how to use them in a theoretical and practical way as we will do, and this is in order to facilitate the creation of programs in the correct way as you want it without wasting time or complication.
         </p>
<p>
          We created this course for you if you want to boost your Python career to become a productive Python programmer .
          <br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
            What are the topics that we will discuss in this course?
           </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
          First, we will talk about iterators in the Python language, how to use them, the concepts and functions related to them, how to create them, and what is the purpose of creating them easily.
         </p>
<p>
          Simply, Iterator in Python is simply an object that can be iterated upon. An object which will return data, one element at a time.
         </p>
<p>
          This is a brief and simple definition of Python iterator.
         </p>
<p>
          Let's go to the second section, which we will talk about.
         </p>
<p>
          In the second section we will talk about The Python scope Of all kinds and how to deal with them.
         </p>
<p>
          Not all variables or functions can be accessed from anywhere in a program. The part of a program where a variable or function is accessible is called its scope.
         </p>
<p>
          The section that next, we'll talk about the string formatting To make sure a string will display as expected . and You’ll learn about these formatting techniques in detail and add them to your Python string formatting toolkit.
         </p>
<p>
          And in the fourth section we will know all about:
          <br/>
          What generators in Python are and how to use them
         </p>
<p>
          How to build generator functions and expressions
         </p>
<p>
          How the Python yield statement works and the difference between yield and return.
         </p>
<p>
          How to use multiple Python yield statements in a generator function.
         </p>
<p>
          How to use advanced generator methods in your apps.
         </p>
<p>
          The section that next, you’ll learn everything about regular expressions in Python.
         </p>
<p>
          This is a very important topic, and we will talk about it in a detailed and practical way and with deep clarification. Actually, You’ll have all power of regular expressions, You will work with the re library, deal with pattern matching, and many more.
          <br/>
          Basically, Regular Expressions are a tool for matching patterns in text. This is a brief and simple definition of Regular Expressions.
         </p>
<p>
          In the next section, you’ll master the most commonly used data structures from the Python collections module.
          <br/>
          Basically, Collections in Python are containers that are used to store collections of data, for example, lists and dictionaries. These are built-in collections. Several modules have been developed that provide additional data structures to store collections of data. One such module is the Python collections module.
         </p>
<p>
          The collections module is used to improve the functionalities of the built-in collection containers.
         </p>
<p>
          The next section walks you through how to package a simple Python project. It will show you how to add the necessary files and structure to create the package, how to build the package, and how to use this Package.
         </p>
<p>
          In the next section, you’ll master all about math and statistics modules practically, and the functions that are used with them.
         </p>
<p>
          Simply, the math module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard. and The statistics module provides functions for calculating mathematical statistics of numeric data.
         </p>
<p>
          Finally, In the last part of this course you will learn something very important, which is decoration.
         </p>
<p>
          In this section on decorators, we’ll look at what they are and how to create and use them in detail.
         </p>
<p>
          Simply and By definition, a decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it. that’s it . We will simplify this topic very without complication, and with practical examples to illustrate.
          <br/>

</ul>
<br/>
<p>
          From this course, you can learn
          <strong>
           Git from basics to advanced concepts.
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          This course was created for software engineers who want to learn how to track changes with the help of Git. No matter what programming language you use - the git is equal for everyone :)
         </p>
<p>
          There are a lot of other courses on this topic.
          <strong>
           So, why would you choose exactly this course?
          </strong>
          Here are just a few reasons:
          <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
           - Real-life cases &amp;demo during the video lesson
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          There are a lot of other courses that taught you Git. But there are only PowerPoint presentations and nice diagrams. You may learn hundreds of git commands but you won't be able to apply them in real life after that courses.
          <br/>
<br/>
          In this course, we will imitate teamwork and work on one project from scratch. We will review different life scenarios online, on the video, I will show you the best way to approach various cases.
          <br/>
<br/>
          You are going to learn enough theory to understand practical examples and exercises. No watter :)Only Git!
          <br/>
<br/>
<strong>
           - Practical orientation of the course
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          This is what makes this course so unique. During the course, we are not talking about super abstract things and inventing our own Git. Your focus is put on the questions that you will face on daily basis during the software development. That's why this course is called 'Practical Guide for Developers'.
          <br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           - Q&amp;A support
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer.
          <br/>
          In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
<em>
            So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?:)), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course.
           </em>
</strong>
<br/>
<br/>
<strong>
           - Relevant knowledge
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!
         </p>
<p>
          The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IToutsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTWmost of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha.
         </p>
<p>
          With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best ITconsultants in the world.
          <br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           - High concentration of useful material in each lesson
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson.
         </p>
<p>
          This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes
          <strong>
<em>
            10 times as much (sometimes even 20)
           </em>
</strong>
          as the final lesson duration after video editing.
         </p>
<p>
          Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered.

          course is taught by two world-renowned communications trainers, TJ Walker and Derek Smith.
         </p>
<p>
          Message from Derek Smith:
         </p>
<p>
          My name is Derek, I’m a native Brit and a qualified and experienced
          <strong>
           TEFL/TESOL trainer
          </strong>
          .
         </p>
<p>
          I have been teaching
          <strong>
           English to adults
          </strong>
          for over 10 years and look forward to using technology to reach a wider audience.
         </p>
<p>
          I have a neutral accent which is clear and easy to understand.
         </p>
<p>
          This might not be the longest course on Udemy but I do respect your time.
         </p>
<p>
          The lessons are as long as necessary, and as short as possible.
         </p>
<p>
          Downloadable PDFs for each lesson will form a valuable resource collection for you.
         </p>
<p>
          The course is not designed to be accessed in sequence but takes more of a pick-and-mix approach.
         </p>
<p>
          For example, if you need help with prepositions of place, simply go to the prepositions section and look for the lesson on prepositions of place.
         </p>
<p>
          Or if you need help with present perfect continuous, go to the tenses and aspects section and check out the lesson on present perfect continuous.
         </p>
<p>
          The exception to this is the Beginner’s Section, which is intended to be accessed from start to finish, in order.
         </p>
<p>
          Where there are differences between UK and US grammar, these are explained in the lesson.
         </p>
<p>
          I encourage you to ask questions if you feel that something has not been fully or clearly explained. You will get an answer and, if necessary, the course material will be updated. Depending on the answer, I will add a new lesson to the course.

<p>
          I have been teaching executives around the globe to deliver presentations in English for the last 30 years. Most people, even native English speakers, are insecure about their English grammar. You can become an accomplished speaker and communicator and know that you are using excellent English Grammar every time you speak.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is hastily turning into important in the daily happenings of the virtual global, with marketing and advertising and marketing being no exception. The idea of AI may also bring to thought 60’s sci-fi with futuristic robots, however, it’s definitely approximately so much greater. With the right understanding and evaluation of data and input, AI is playing an essential position in figuring out marketing trends. Brands and marketers are incorporating Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to save time and assets. Earlier, marketers have been reluctant to use AI in their marketing strategies. But now, many hit brands like Amazon and Spotify have adopted it and use it as their advertising gear. For example, Amazon makes use of AI to show the most effective relevant merchandise to buyers, based totally on preceding purchases, searches, and perspectives. It can likely boom the probabilities of a customer to purchase greater products with the pretty sought-after personalised enjoy.

<em>
            How Artificial Intelligence-based Digital Marketing Revolution is on the rise?
           </em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
          We are right at the beginning of the AI revolution but we already have a good sense of how artificial intelligence is going to change digital marketing's face.Artificial Intelligence usage in digital marketing will change the entire world with marketers embracing this futuristic tech.
         </p>
<p>
          If you're not yet absolutely on the bandwagon or just start plunging your toes into the ice, you're not the only one. The way consumers respond to marketing messages and interact with them is changing. Traditional methods of marketing such as media advertising and direct mail are no longer as successful as they were once.
         </p>
<p>
          One reason for this is that today's consumers expect marketers to adapt their demographics or preferences to their messages. Artificial Intelligence is starting to go hand in hand with digital marketing. AI transforms digital strategy with the ability to collect data, interpret it, apply it, and then learn from it. The ability to use it to improve digital marketing strategies and valuable customer insights for companies will be the same as it continues to advance. Excellent customer service is the also most important aspect of an effective digital marketing campaign this too can be automated by Google Duplex kind of tools that are created in the market.

          Why is this secretive course in
          <strong>
           ""Artificial Intelligence in Digital Marketing -7 Courses in 1""
          </strong>
          - the best one in the industry?
         </p>
<p>
          Artificial intelligence keeps growing and improving and will not slow down for a while. Implementing AI into your digital marketing strategy will help customers' experience better and provide your business with the insights it needs to succeed.
         </p>
<p>
          What’s more? The ultimate secret of the course is that we will also tell you about a tool that you can use for unlimited lead-generation using another secretive artificial intelligence(AI) technology. There is often a disconnection between sales and marketing departments in many businesses. This is typically due to a lack of interaction or shared attention. Marketers may give sales a lead they believe to be ideal, but sales are not. It creates tension between two teams to work together, and AI is the perfect way to bring them together. AI can point out positive sales leads, which will also satisfy marketing, and ensure that potential customers are targeted at the right platforms. You don't want the company that sells accounting software to be advertised by someone. All teams will need to come together and agree on an optimal customer profile, a profile that fits marketing and sales, to better use AI in the B2B lead generation.
         </p>
<p>
          The profile can consist of multiple variables, such as sector, company level, and how many employees they have. The standards are almost infinite. The AI will use the profile to measure current and potential leads against a selection of pre-defined behavioural criteria. Without us providing all this, the AI will fumble around, essentially throwing darts at a board while blindfolded. The AI can predict future patterns for lead generation, possible spending, and what campaigns or services will draw their interest from this. Ok, having given all this information that focuses on ""Artificial intelligence in digital marketing"", the question is
          <strong>
           ""Are you ready to get into action and embrace the power to leverage artificial intelligence in digital marketing?”.

           </p>
<p>
            In this section you will learn about the single cells or Perceptrons and how Perceptrons are stacked to create a network architecture. Once architecture is set, we understand the Gradient descent algorithm to find the minima of a function and learn how this is used to optimize our network model.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Part 3 - Creating Regression and Classification ANN model in Python and R

</p>
<p>
            In this part you will learn how to create ANN models in Python.
           </p>
<p>
            We will start this section by creating an ANN model using Sequential API to solve a classification problem. We learn how to define network architecture, configure the model and train the model. Then we evaluate the performance of our trained model and use it to predict on new data. We also solve a regression problem in which we try to predict house prices in a location. We will also cover how to create complex ANN architectures using functional API. Lastly we learn how to save and restore models.
           </p>
<p>
            We also understand the importance of libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow in this part.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>
             Part 4 - Data Preprocessing
            </strong>
</p>
<p>
            In this part you will learn what actions you need to take to prepare Data for the analysis, these steps are very important for creating a meaningful.
           </p>
<p>
            In this section, we will start with the basic theory of decision tree then we cover data pre-processing topics like
            <strong>
</strong>
            missing value imputation, variable transformation and Test-Train split.
            <strong>

<p>
          Below are some popular FAQs of students who want to start their Deep learning journey-
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why use Python for Deep Learning?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Deep Learning.
         </p>
<p>
          Though it hasn’t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here’s a brief history:
         </p>
<p>
          In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.
         </p>
<p>
          In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets’s annual poll of data scientists’ most used tools.
         </p>
<p>
          In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.
         </p>
<p>
          Deep Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it’s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge—and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.
         </p>
<p>
          Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.

<p>
          Hello everyone and welcome to Adobe Premiere Pro 2022 Ultimate Guide.
         </p>
<p>
          In this video, we're going to go over a course overview of what we're going to be learning throughout the course.
         </p>
<p>
          So in Section two, we're going to be covering creative cloud plans.
         </p>
<p>
          So we'll cover individuals, business students and teachers and schools and universities.
         </p>
<p>
          Then we'll learn how to set up a free creative cloud account.
         </p>
<p>
          Next, we'll work on Adobe Creative Cloud Web and learn how to install Adobe Premiere Pro 2022.
         </p>
<p>
          From there, we'll learn about the welcome page, which you can see right here.
         </p>
<p>
          Welcome to Premiere Pro and we'll talk about how to create a new project, how to open a project home.
         </p>
<p>
          Learn New Team Project, New Team Project Open Premiere Rush Project.
         </p>
<p>
          How to Search.
         </p>
<p>
          See what's new in Premiere Pro.
         </p>
<p>
          And how to check out our account.
         </p>
<p>
          Then we'll build out a simple project.
         </p>
<p>
          Now, this is the final project that I built right here, which is project number 30.
         </p>
<p>
          And what I'll do is I'll open up.
         </p>
<p>
          Uh, let's do introduction.
         </p>
<p>
          Okay.
         </p>
<p>
          So you can see that.
         </p>
<p>
          And what I'll do is once we open this up.
         </p>
<p>
          We'll talk about what we're going to be learning throughout the course.
         </p>
<p>
          So we're going to cover the main menu up here.
         </p>
<p>
          So file at it, clip sequence markers, graphics and titles, view window and help.
         </p>
<p>
          And then inside of the Window menu, we're going to learn about workspaces.
         </p>
<p>
          So all panels, assembly, audio captions and graphics, color editing effects, learning libraries,
         </p>
<p>
          mental logging and production review how to Reset.
         </p>
<p>
          I save layout how to save changes to a workspace, how to save as a new workspace and how to edit workspaces
         </p>
<p>
          and how to import workspaces from projects.
         </p>
<p>
          So we'll cover all of that in depth.
         </p>
<p>
          Then we'll talk about all of these panels and what they do inside of Premiere Pro and why they're why
         </p>
<p>
          are they important to use?
         </p>
<p>
          Okay.
         </p>
<p>
          And this is where the basic project comes in.
         </p>
<p>
          We're going to be using content that's already inside of after effects, not aftereffects, but Premiere
         </p>
<p>
          Pro, and we'll build out a sample project with that going over all of these tools and interfaces,
         </p>
<p>
          then we'll talk about preferences.
         </p>
<p>
          Okay?
         </p>
<p>
          So we'll cover all of these preferences right here and learn how we can use the preferences to customize
         </p>
<p>
          the premiere pro application experience custom to what you want.
         </p>
<p>
          Okay.
         </p>
<p>
          Then from there we're going to learn about tools.
         </p>
<p>
          So we'll cover all of these tools here.
         </p>
<p>
          And again, we'll be building on a basic project.
         </p>
<p>
          It won't be this project that you see here, but it will be a basic project with content that's already
         </p>
<p>
          inside of Not After Effects, but Premiere Pro.
         </p>
<p>
          Okay, then we're going to get to the bread and butter of the course, which is production.
         </p>
<p>
          And what we're going to do is we're going to learn how to create a production.
         </p>
<p>
          And you can see here there's four projects in this production.
         </p>
<p>
          If I close that production out, okay, and then I open up project number 24, that's going to open
         </p>
<p>
          up my other production, which has roughly about ten projects in there.
         </p>
<p>
          Okay.
         </p>
<p>
          And we're going to learn how to organize our projects inside of a production.
         </p>
<p>
          Okay.
         </p>
<p>
          Where basically what that is, is as you're putting multiple projects in one area, which in and premiere
         </p>
<p>
          pro, they call that a production which I think is a brilliant idea and a great tool for people that
         </p>
<p>
          have a lot of projects to do.
         </p>
<p>
          It's a simple way to organize your projects in one spot.
         </p>
<p>
          Okay.
         </p>
<p>
          And once we're done with all those projects, we're going to build 30 projects from scratch.
         </p>
<p>
          And we're also going to utilize my website, which is learn tech project files dot com.
         </p>
<p>
          And we're going to learn.
         </p>
<p>
          With Premiere Pro Projects, and I'll show you kind of an overview of all the projects that we're going
         </p>
<p>
          to be building.
         </p>
<p>
          We're going to use this website Learn Tech Project Files dot com to download the source files for each
         </p>
<p>
          one of those projects, and we'll do them individually.
         </p>
<p>
          Okay.
         </p>
<p>
          It's going to be a lot of fun.
         </p>
<p>
          It'll take a little bit of time, but it'll be a lot of fun.
         </p>
<p>
          So get excited about that.
         </p>
<p>
          And once we do those 30 projects, then we'll wrap everything up with the summary and the thank you
         </p>
<p>
          video.
         </p>
<p>
          And with that, I want to thank you so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video.

<p>
            We have covered the basic theory behind each concept without getting too mathematical about it so that you understand where the concept is coming from and how it is important. But even if you don't understand it, it will be okay as long as you learn how to run and interpret the result as taught in the practical lectures.
           </p>
<p>
            We also look at how to quantify models accuracy, what is the meaning of F statistic, how categorical variables in the independent variables dataset are interpreted in the results, what are other variations to the ordinary least squared method and how do we finally interpret the result to find out the answer to a business problem.
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
          By the end of this course, your confidence in creating a regression model in Python will soar. You'll have a thorough understanding of how to use regression modelling to create predictive models and solve business problems.

         </p>
<p>
          Below is a list of popular FAQs of students who want to start their Machine learning journey-
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           What is Machine Learning?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Machine Learning is a field of computer science which gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           What is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Linear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.
         </p>
<p>
          Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).
         </p>
<p>
          When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.
         </p>
<p>
          When there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          There are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:
         </p>
<p>
          1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique
         </p>
<p>
          2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy
         </p>
<p>
          3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret
         </p>
<p>
          4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           How much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Linear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          You can divide your learning process into 4 parts:
         </p>
<p>
          Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.
         </p>
<p>
          Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model
         </p>
<p>
          Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python
         </p>
<p>
          Understanding of Linear Regression modelling - Having a good knowledge of Linear Regression gives you a solid understanding of how machine learning works. Even though Linear regression is the simplest technique of Machine learning, it is still the most popular one with fairly good prediction ability. Fifth and sixth section cover Linear regression topic end-to-end and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Why use Python for data Machine Learning?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.
         </p>
<p>
          Though it hasn’t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here’s a brief history:
         </p>
<p>
          In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.
         </p>
<p>
          In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets’s annual poll of data scientists’ most used tools.
         </p>
<p>
          In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.
         </p>
<p>
          Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it’s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge—and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.
         </p>
<p>
          Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.

<p>
<strong>
           Why learn SQL?
          </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
            SQL is the most universal and common used database language.It powers the most commonly used database engines like PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite, and MySQL. Simply put,If you want to access databases then yes, you need to know SQL.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            It is not really difficult to learn SQL. SQL is not a programming language, it’s a query language. The primary objective where SQL was created was to give the possibility to common people get interested data from database. It is also an English like language so anyone who can use English at a basic level can write SQL query easily.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            SQL is one of the most sought-after skills by hiring employers.

<strong>
           What's the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          SQL is a language. Specifically, the ""Structured Query Language""
         </p>
<p>
          PostgreSQL is one of several database systems, or RDMS (Relational Database Management System). PostgresSQL is one of several RDMS's, others of which are Oracle, Informix, MySQL, and MSQL.
         </p>
<p>
          All of these RDMSs use SQL as their language. Each of them have minor variations in the ""dialect"" of SQL that they use, but it's all still SQL.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           What is BigQuery used for?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           BigQuery
          </strong>
          is a web service from Google that is
          <strong>
           used for
          </strong>
          handling or analyzing big data. Google BigQuery is part of the Google Cloud Platform. As a NoOps (no operations) data analytics service,
          <strong>
           Google BigQuery
          </strong>
          offers users the ability to manage data using fast SQL-like queries for real-time analysis.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>

<p>
          Welcome to - Learn Ethical Hacking From A-Z: Beginner To Expert Course!
         </p>
<p>
          This practical, hands-on course was created for newbies – that's to say, people with
          <strong>
           no prior training or knowledge
          </strong>
          in hacking and cybersecurity. The aim of this course is to give you the education not just to understand what black-hat hatters do and how, but also to
          <strong>
           learn exactly how to hack systems like a pro
          </strong>
          and win the cat and mouse game by securing systems like a
          <strong>
           professional security expert
          </strong>
          .
         </p>
<p>
          Blending practical work with solid theoretical training, we take you from the
          <strong>
           basics of ethical hacking through to mastery
          </strong>
          , giving you the training you need not just to hack, but also to secure against a hack.
         </p>
<p>
          While the theory is important, we understand that it can also be dry and uninspiring. For this reason, this course is packed with examples that you can follow. This practical focus starts from the beginning, where we will teach you about
          <strong>
           penetration testing
          </strong>
          and show you how to install the software required (Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX) and jump right into hacking.
         </p>
<p>
          Throughout, you will
          <strong>
           analyze and exploit various systems
          </strong>
          from regular websites through to sprawling networks, along with
          <strong>
           hacking servers
          </strong>
          and clients. More than just hacking, you'll also learn how to conduct efficient penetration testing techniques.
         </p>
<p>
          This approach gives you the foundational education that you need not just to hack any given system, but also to secure it, with each module covering both sides of the coin. The course covers six main areas:
          <br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           1: LEARN THE FUNDAMENTALS NECESSARY TO BECOME A HACKER
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          This foundational section gives you a full introduction to the basics of networking systems – how they communicate and work – and is designed to give you the knowledge you need to succeed in this course.
         </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            BASICS OF NETWORKING: Networking can be an intimidating topic, but don’t worry! We break down only the necessary things that you need to know in regards to networking and teach you important networking fundamentals
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            SETTING UP A HACKING LAB: You can’t hack without a lab! We walk you step-by-step through the process of setting up your own hacking lab on your laptop or desktop computer!
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            LINUX + SCRIPTING BASICS: Hackers use Linux, which is an OS that the average person may have no experience with. We will go over Linux fundamentals so that you can easily navigate your way through Linux during this course. We also touch on a couple of scripting languages that are a MUST for any ethical hacker and teach you the basics of each one with practical examples.
           </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
            HIDING YOUR IDENTITY ON THE WEB: If you are hacking on the internet, you need to learn how to remain anonymous. We will show you the tools and techniques that you can use to always remain anonymous and unknown on the internet.
            <br/>
<br/>
</p>
</li>
</ul>

           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            CLIENT-SIDE ATTACK: Learn how to hack systems with no vulnerabilities by sneaking in with software updates or using backdoor trojan downloads. You’ll also learn the art of social engineering – or tricking people into giving you information
            <br/>
<br/>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
           4: HOW TO LEVERAGE POST EXPLOITATION
          </strong>
</p>
<p>

            ACCESS FILE SYSTEMS: All systems have a wealth of files that you can now manipulate with your access. Learn how to access these systems and how to read, write, upload, and even execute files
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            MAINTAIN ACCESS: Gaining access to a system and its files is only half of the battle. Learn how to maintain your access and frustrate efforts to secure it again so you can continue to exploit a system
           </p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
            SPY ON YOUR TARGET: Learn how to capture any keystrokes on a keyboard, turn on a computer webcam, take screenshots, and even take control of the system to attack, hack, and access third-party networks and systems
            <br/>
<br/>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>

<li>

          </li>
<li>
           Define IaaS, PaaS, SaaS and XaaS and understand how they differ from each other
          </li>
<li>
           Understand the IaaS options including virtual machines on shared physical servers, virtual machines on dedicated servers, and dedicated bare-metal servers
          </li>
<li>
           Deploy a virtual machine on Amazon Web Services IaaS

<li>
           Deploy an application on IBM Bluemix PaaS

</ul>
<br/>
<p>
          The 2nd top hit for 'Cloud Computing'on Google says'Cloud computing is a general term for the delivery of hosted services over the internet.' Unfortunately, that definition is completely wrong.
         </p>
<p>
          This course is designed to clear up the many misunderstandings about Cloud Computing and to give you a crystal clear and easy to understand explanation of exactly what it is, how it works, the different options available, the advantages provided and how much it's going to cost.
         </p>
<p>
          And I'm not just going to give you the theory, I'm going to show you practical examples which you can follow along with yourself so you'll understand exactly how Cloud Computing works in the real world.
          <br/>
</p>
<p>
          I start off with a review in Module 1 of the traditional deployment models of On Premises and Colo so you can understand how Cloud changes things, then explain how server virtualisation revolutionised data center design and paved the way for Cloud.
         </p>
<p>
          Module 2 defines Cloud Computing by listingthe Essential Characteristics of Cloud services.
         </p>
<p>
          You'll learn about the Cloud Service Models ofIaaS, PaaS, SaaS, andXaaS in Module 3. I start with an overview of the different modelsand then dive deep into the details and options ofeach. Ialso give lab demos of how to deploy each type.
         </p>
<p>
          The Cloud Deployment Models ofPublic Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud and Community Cloud are covered in Module 4.
         </p>
<p>
          Finally in Module 5 I list out the advantages of Cloud Computing and then break out the spreadsheet toshow you how to do a TCOcost comparison when choosingbetween an On Premise or Cloud deployment for a real world workload.
         </p>
<p>
          A verifiable course certificate stating you have completed this training will be provided at the end of the course. This will prove to potential future employers that you have the basic cloud knowledge necessary to be an effective member of their IT team, and the motivationto complete further training and be areal asset to their company.

             Louay is an excellent teacher. There is so much in this course, and there is no way that you can remember everything. However, I think it is the best overview of AE available. I've already come back to review certain portions of the course when working on various projects, and that is very helpful. Making good use of the Notes feature too for such a large course is helpful. Louay was extremely fast at responding to questions and viewing my work that I posted on YT. I would highly recommend this course.

             When I learn anything online, the first thing I have to like is the instructor's voice. You're going to be listening to this person for a long time so you want to feel comfortable with the way they talk. Louay is awesome. The entire time I spent learning (and it was little bits mostly every day) it was like you were in a proper class with one of your friends showing you how to do things. He's got a great sense of humour and doesn't go so fast it's all a blur. I'm in no ways an expert on After Effects now, but I have a really good grounding to keep going. Highly Recommended!!! Thanks Louay. And if you're ever in Brisbane, Australia. Ping me a message and I'll take you out to dinner :) ""

           Why learn to make Android apps?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          · Android is without a doubt THE biggest mobile platform in the world, with over 80% market share and over 1 billion devices sold in 2016alone.
         </p>
<p>
          · You can develop for Android on a Windows, Mac or Linux computer.
         </p>
<p>
          · Java is a fantastic language to learn, allowing you to make apps for PC, Mac and the web, as well as Android.
         </p>
<p>
          · Android app discovery is way superior to the App Store, so your app has a far better chance of getting seen—and bought.
         </p>
<p>
          · Ad-based revenue is a lot more common on Android than on iOS, and a cinch to set up with Google Ads.

          This course is part-one of the nine-part series that starts by taking an in-depth look at how the internet facilitates the movement of data packets across both LANs (Local Area Network) and WANs (Wide Area Network). Students learn how to interpret various protocols such as TCP/IP, HTTP, HTTPs, SMTP and FTP. We examine the entire flow and life-cycle of data-packet movement from origin to destination. The course examines the role of DNS and SMTP servers in routing internet traffic and email transmissions. Mechanism to safeguard the movement of data, such as network routers, ports and firewalls, are also explored.
         </p>
<p>
          Students are then introduced to the web development process and planning stages of building websites and complex web applications. We conduct an overview of web hosting infrastructures such as shared, VPS, Dedicated and Cloud hosting solutions through case analysis. We then take a look at the role of Domain name registrars and ICANN (The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). Students learn to register and administer domain names through the GoDaddy domain management console. Management features such as Name Server assignment, auto-renewal, domain privacy, and domain forwarding will be covered.
         </p>
<p>
          With first-hand insights into the creation of effective web infrastructures and domain management, students learn to configure local testing servers. This includes installing and configuring WAMP/MAMP (Windows/MAC, Apache, MySQL, PhpMyAdmin) on a PC or MAC system. We discuss the role of each essential service as it applies to testing dynamic, database-driven web applications on a local computing system.
         </p>
<p>
          Students then explore the configuration of a live production server using popular cloud hosting providers such as Linode. This includes deployment and administration of Ubuntu on Linux based distributions and essential web services (LAMP Stack - Linux, Apache, MySQL, PhpMyAdmin) on scalable virtual machines. Several remote access tools such as PuTTy and Terminal will be used to administer virtual servers through the use of command lines. Servers will be configured with security in mind, using multi-user accounts, SSH authentication, and file permission management.
         </p>
<p>
          Students also learn to install and connect to their virtual machines using remote desktop connection tools such as Tight VNC and Real VNC. The entire Linode management console will be explored to demonstrate how to complete various tasks including: creating backups, server re-sizing, changing root passwords, DNS management, and general administration.
         </p>
<p>
          Lastly, the course takes a look at FTP clients and establishing connections from local machines to production servers to upload web content. We will explore the FileZilla interface and provide demonstrations on uploading, deleting and modifying remote server files.

<strong>
           How are charts useful in Excel?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          A chart is a tool you can use in Excel to communicate data graphically. Charts allow your audience to see the meaning behind the numbers, and they make showing comparisons and trends much easier.
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           What are the benefits of using charts in Excel?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Excel charts allow spreadsheet administrators to create visualizations of data sets. By highlighting a set of data within an Excel spreadsheet and feeding it into the charting tool, users can easily create various types of charts in which the data is displayed in a graphical way.
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           This course will answer all the questions that would pop up while you set to visualize your data using Excel charts such as:
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          How do you make Excel charts look better?
         </p>
<p>
          How do you format a chart in Excel?
         </p>
<p>
          What are the different elements of charts?
         </p>
<p>
          How do I make those awesome infographics that I see in fancy magazines and TV reports?
         </p>
<p>
          How do I create a comparison chart in Excel?
         </p>
<p>
          What is the best chart to use for comparison?
         </p>
<p>
          And many more...
         </p>
<p>
<br/>
</p>
<p>
<strong>
           How is this course different from other resources available online?
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          Most courses cover only teach how to draw different types of charts in Excel. The main point is missed. The main point of creating a chart is that you want to convey a message or tell a story using the chart. In this course, once you have learnt all the charting tools, you will also learn how you should create a chart. How you can highlight your message and avoid clutter in the chart, so that when your audience looks at the chart, the message is clearly conveyed to them.

<p>
<strong>
           If you have decided to learn R as your data science programming language, you have made an excellent decision!
          </strong>
</p>
<p>
          R is the most widely used tool for statistical programming. It is powerful, versatile and easy to use. It is the first choice for thousands of data analysts working in both companies and academia. This course will help you master the basics of R in a short time, as a first step to become a skilled R data scientist.
         </p>
<p>
          The course is meant for absolute beginners, so you don’t have to know anything about R before starting. (You don’t even have to have the R program on your computer; I will show you how to install it.) But after graduating this course you will have the most important R programming skills – and you will be able to further develop these skills, by practicing, starting from what you will have learned in the course.
         </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
          This course contains about 100 video lectures in nine sections.
         </p>
<p>
          In the first section of this course you will
          <strong>
           get started
          </strong>
          with R: you will install the program (in case you didn’t do it already), you will familiarize with the working interface in R Studio and you will learn some basic technical stuff like installing and activating packages or setting the working directory. Moreover, you will learn how to perform simple operations in R and how to work with variables.
         </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
          The next five sections will be dedicated to the five types of
          <strong>
           data structures
          </strong>
          in R: vectors, matrices, lists, factors and data frames. So you’ll learn how to manipulate data structures: how to index them, how to edit data, how to filter data according to various criteria, how to create and modify objects (or variables), how to apply functions to data and much more. These are very important topics, because R is a software for statistical computing and most of the R programming is about manipulating data. So before getting to more advanced statistical analyses in R you must know the basic techniques of data handling.
         </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
          After finishing with the data structures we’ll get to the
          <strong>
           programming structures
          </strong>
          in R. In this section you’ll learn about loops, conditional statements and functions. You’ll learn how to combine loops and conditional statements to perform complex tasks, and how to create custom functions that you can save and reuse later. We will also study some practical examples of functions.
         </p>
<p>
          The next section is about
          <strong>
           working with strings
          </strong>
          . Here we will cover the most useful functions that allow us to manipulate strings. So you will learn how to format strings for printing, how to concatenate strings, how to extract substrings from a given string and especially how to create regular expressions that identify patterns in strings.
         </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
          In the following section you’ll learn how to
          <strong>
           build charts
          </strong>
          in R. We are going to cover seven types of charts: dot chart (scatterplot), line chart, bar chart, pie chart, histogram, density line and boxplot. Moreover, you will learn how to plot a function of one variable and how to export the charts you create.
         </p>
<p>
          Every command and function is visually explained: you can see the output live. At the end of each section you will find a PDF file with practical exercises that allow you to apply and strengthen your knowledge.
         </p>
<p>
          So if you want to learn R from scratch, you need this course.
          <strong>
           Enroll right now and begin a fantastic R programming journey!

          There goes a chinese proverb -
          <em>
<strong>
            ""Tell me, I'll forget. Show me, I'll remember. Involve me, I'll understand.""
           </strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
          The highest degree of learning takes place with your involvement. And this course is designed to do exactly that. This course introduces you to the basics of Android development. You will need some Java fundamentals to get started. If you are not sure about the difference between an
          <em>
           abstract class
          </em>
          and an
          <em>
           interface
          </em>
          you might have to refresh your Java concepts before proceeding.
         </p>
<p>
          Also, if you are new to Java I recommend John Purcell's Java Course, in order to acquire the minimal Java programming skills required to step into Android development.
         </p>
<p>
          I've also got you some companion code which you can download from the appropriate lectures. You'll be working on the source code along with me, so that you could get a good grasp on the concepts you will eventually be introduced to. At the end of this course you'll be able to
          <em>
           write
          </em>
          and
          <em>

           Communication Skills
          </strong>
          are the most important personal skills you can ever develop for your success in life. Life is a series of communications. Those who develop strong
          <strong>
           communicationskills
          </strong>
          do well in school, secure jobs, and promotions and often ascend to the highest levels of leadership in corporations, governments, and civic life. People who fail to develop
          <strong>
           communicationskills
          </strong>
          often have their careers stagnate or plateau in the mid-range. Sadly,
          <strong>
           presentation skills
          </strong>
          are either not taught in primary or secondary education or are taught poorly.

El mejor curso de JavaScript en todo Internet. Punto!
         </p>
<p>
          ¿Quieres aprender el lenguaje de programación número # 1 que alimenta Internet?
         </p>
<p>
          ¿Está cansado de perder su tiempo y dinero en videos de YouTube o cursos de JavaScript que son demasiado simples o difíciles de seguir?
         </p>
<p>
          ¿O estás luchando por comprender y aplicar JavaScript a proyectos reales?
         </p>
<p>
          Si su respuesta es un gran SÍ ... ¡Este es exactamente el curso que está buscando!
         </p>
<p>
          Entonces, ¿de qué se trata el curso?
         </p>
<p>
          Este es un curso de JavaScript realmente completo, que va más allá de lo que otros cursos de JavaScript te enseñan.
         </p>
<p>
<strong>
           Te llevaré desde un nivel principiante en JavaScript hasta un desarrollador avanzado y muy completo
          </strong>
          . No solo aprenderás el lenguaje JavaScript en sí, sino que también aprenderá cómo programar. Cómo resolver problemas. Cómo estructurar y organizar el código utilizando patrones comunes de JavaScript.
         </p>
<p>
          Ven conmigo en un viaje con el objetivo de entender realmente el lenguaje JavaScript. ¡Y te lo explico todo en el camino con gran detalle!
         </p>
<p>
          Aprenderás ""por qué"" algo funciona en JavaScript, no solo ""cómo"". Porque en el mundo moderno de JavaScript de hoy, necesita algo más que saber cómo funciona algo. Debes depurar el código, debes comprender el código, necesitas poder pensar en el código.
         </p>
<p>
          Para lograr nuestro objetivo juntos, el curso contiene sesiones de codificación, desafíos de codificación, clases teóricas, proyectos del mundo real y un proyecto final del curso.
         </p>
<p>
          Este curso es diferente porque no se trata solo de escribir código, también se trata de cómo y por qué el código funciona como lo hace. Porque es la mezcla perfecta entre teoría y práctica. Porque se enfoca no solo en pequeños ejemplos de codificación, sino también en proyectos del mundo real y casos de uso.
         </p>
<p>
          Entonces, al final del curso, serás un desarrollador de JavaScript capaz de escribir, entender y depurar el código JavaScript utilizando todas las funciones poderosas que el idioma nos ofrece.

          In this section you will learn what actions you need to take a step by step to get the data and then prepare it for the analysis these steps are very important.
         </p>
<p>
          We start with understanding the importance of business knowledge then we will see how to do data exploration. We learn how to do uni-variate analysis and bi-variate analysis then we cover topics like
          <strong>
           outlier treatment and missing value imputation.

</ul>
<p>
          This section starts with simple linear regression and then covers multiple linear regression.We have covered the basic theory behind each concept without getting too mathematical about it so that you understand where the concept is coming from and how it is important. But even if you don't understand it, it will be okay as long as you learn how to run and interpret the result as taught in the practical lectures.
         </p>
<p>
          We also look at how to quantify models accuracy, what is the meaning of F statistic, how categorical variables in the independent variables dataset are interpreted in the results.

          This part will give you a solid understanding of concepts involved in Neural Networks.
         </p>
<p>
          In this section you will learn about the single cells or Perceptrons and how Perceptrons are stacked to create a network architecture. Once architecture is set, we understand the Gradient descent algorithm to find the minima of a function and learn how this is used to optimize our network model.

<strong>
             Section 8 - Creating Regression and Classification ANN model in Python
            </strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
          In this part you will learn how to create ANN models in Python.
         </p>
<p>
          We will start this section by creating an ANN model using Sequential API to solve a classification problem. We learn how to define network architecture, configure the model and train the model. Then we evaluate the performance of our trained model and use it to predict on new data. We also solve a regression problem in which we try to predict house prices in a location. We will also cover how to create complex ANN architectures using functional API. Lastly we learn how to save and restore models.

<p>
          I am pretty confident that the course will give you the necessary knowledge and skills related to time series forecasting, time series analysis and Python time series techniques to immediately see practical benefits in your work place.
